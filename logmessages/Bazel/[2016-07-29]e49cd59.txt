  Allow objc rule deps to include any rule that exports an "objc" provider.  This change was motivated by a need to write pure Skylark rules that expose their own objc providers so they can be used as deps to other libraries/application targets (e.g., SceneKit/SpriteKit compiled resources, []) without having to whitelist them and wait for a Blaze release.  This CL fixes what seems to be a bug in validateRuleDependency, where the behavior in the doc comment implies that it will accept a whitelisted rule name *or* a list of mandatory providers, but as implemented today it seems to require the rule to be whitelisted even if the mandatory native providers matched.  RELNOTES: objc_* rules can now depend on any target that returns an "objc" provider.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=128835096
