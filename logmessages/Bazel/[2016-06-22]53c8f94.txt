  *** Reason for rollback ***  Introduced classpath ordering bug  *** Original change description ***  Fix analysis performance regression caused by header compilation  When building --direct_dependency/--indirect_dependency args, use a set for the direct jars to avoid an O(n) contains check, and make the CustomMultiArgv class static to avoid a memory leak. Also avoid flattening the NestedSet of direct jars for as long as possible.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=125541563
