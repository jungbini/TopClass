  Change the path of gcc for Windows to c:\tools\msys64 , because that's where Chocolatey installs msys2.  This is only a temporary hack to get our continuous build up and running, because we can't assume that everyone will install their C++ compiler there. But then again, msys2 is not a very useful target for Windows, so maybe we should fix that first.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=115449817
