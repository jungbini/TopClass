  Fix test configured target creation code that was dropping split deps.  Short story: Dependency -> BuildConfiguration maps can have multiple values because of split transitions.  This is unfortunately one of those instances where the test logic is forked from production. So this doesn't actually demonstrate bugs in production code. We already have tests in ConfigurationsForTargetsTest that directly check the production logic. So this cl's primary value is to unbreak tests that depend on the forked logic.  -- PiperOrigin-RevId: 141094830 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=141094830
