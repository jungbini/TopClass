  sandbox: Allow network access by default, unless a target has a "block-network" tag.  To block network access, you can set the "block-network" tag on a target like this:  genrule( name = "no_access_to_network", cmd = "curl http://www.bazel.io/this_will_fail", tags = [ "block-network" ], )  This is needed to fix a performance issue due to a bug in the Linux kernel: https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/8/28/656  RELNOTES[INC]: Sandboxed actions can access the network by default, unless their target has a "block-network" tag.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=135470811
