  Use the correct Aspect in AspectFunction for Skylark aspects.  Previously AspectFunction was using an Aspect from the SkyKey, which might have been stale.  This CL fixes the bug as uncovered in the test (see SkylarkAspectsTest), but further refactoring is needed since SkylarkAspectClass equals() is incorrect, and in fact obtaining the Skylark aspect definition should always introduce Skyframe dependency.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=119137636
