Sometimes, sha1 values in the generated maven rules contains newlines as shown in the example below, which breaks the build.  maven_jar( name = "com_google_code_findbugs_jsr305", artifact = "com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:1.3.9", sha1 = "40719ea6961c0cb6afaeb6a921eaa1f6afd4cfdf ", )  This change fixes that.  -- Reviewed-on: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/843 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=113776575
