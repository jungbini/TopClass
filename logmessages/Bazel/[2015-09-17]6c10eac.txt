  Cleanup Skylark types some more  Clarify the criterion for being a valid Skylark value; stop claiming immutability is "the" criterion when Skylark now has mutable values; stop relying on a reflection with a magic list (this also fixes the SkylarkShell build). Clarify the criterion for determining immutable types when making a SkylarkNestedSet. Clarify and use the criterion for being a valid Skylark dict key.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=103313934
