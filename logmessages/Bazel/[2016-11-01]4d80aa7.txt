  Do not tickle TimestampGranularityMonitor for CONSTANT_METADATA artifacts.  "Constant metadata" artifacts represent real files whose changes should be ignored by the build system.  However, these artifacts were triggering the timestamp granularity checks in TimestampGranularityMonitor because the fact that they were "constant metadata" was not respected.  Avoid this so that their regeneration does not cause the build to unnecessarily stall.  One of these artifacts is the volatile workspace status file, which is unconditionally updated on each build.  Before this fix, "blaze build" would get stuck for up to a second waiting for file system timestamps to catch up. With this fix, the artifact is ignored and the wait is gone.  This problem is magnified on macOS where the default HFS+ file system only has second-level granularity.  (This also affects Linux, but because current Linux file systems have milli/nanosecond-level granularity, the wait imposed by TimestampGranularityMonitor is minimal and thus not generally noticeable.)  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=137867586
