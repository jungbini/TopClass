  cc_configure.bzl: fix path to static crosstool  Static crosstool where copied in the wrong path, leading to not found package and breaking the Windows build.  Also the BUILD.bazel file contains now a reference to @cc_configure// package, so we need another copy.  Tested: manually patched the change on the Windows slave and ran ./compile.sh  Fixes #1101.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=118674922
