  Implement `realpath(1)` using basic Bash utils.  Neither `realpath` nor `readlink -e` are available on Mac OS X, so I implemented one using basic Bash utilities: `readlink`, `basename`, and `dirname`.  I also implemented a `normalize_path` method that can normalize relative or absolute path strings (remove and resolve "." and ".." references). It uses simple string processing and doesn't touch the file system.  This will help fixing https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/1776 and also opensourcing some shell tests that rely on `realpath`.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=133249912
