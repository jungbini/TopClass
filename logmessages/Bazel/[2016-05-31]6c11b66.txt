  Fix a bug in SkyframeExecutor.getConfigurations() for dynamic configurations:  That calls getDynamicConfigOptions() to get the right BuildOptions for a target, but that fails to trim the option's FragmentOptions. That means, for example, a BuildConfiguration could get constructed with just the CppConfiguration fragment but with a BuildOptions that still has PythonOptions.  This isn't just sloppy. It breaks Bazel tests that use SkyframeExecutor.getConfiguredTargetForTesting (which follows this code path) to compare against the production code path (which already properly trims deps). So two configured targets that should be equal won't be because their BuildConfigurations won't match.  This is also a prerequisite change for trimming top-level configurations, coming up soon.  TESTED: BuildViewTest#testNewActionsAreDifferentAndDontConflict (and other tests) pass with this change + the still-pending top-level-trimming change.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=123676990
