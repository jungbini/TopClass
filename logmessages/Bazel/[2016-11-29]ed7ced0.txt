  Support multiple mirror URLs for external repos  This change improves upon 4c67807964e37cfd55bbcda4c6374fcc480bcecc.  - A urls attribute has been added to the native workspace rules, with the exception of maven_jar and git_repository. The Skylark repository API also supports multiple URLs now.  - The earlier mirrors in the list are preferred. Failover will happen automatically in parallel.  - The first 32kB of data is checked before choosing a mirror in order to evade captive portals.  - If one's Internet goes down or a download times out, then the download will resume automatically where it left off, provided the server supports RFC7233 for that particular file. Please note that GitHub does not support this for archive snapshots. Files should always be mirrored to a CDN, e.g. GCS, because they support this.  - A semaphore is now used on downloads so only 8 can happen at once.
