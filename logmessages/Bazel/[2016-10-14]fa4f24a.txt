  Fix the config creation for --experimental_multi_cpu.  The Android split transition removes the --cpu (as intended), but then the resulting split configurations are identical across the --cpu values set by --experimental_multi_cpu, which triggers a sanity check in BuildConfiguration.  For now, I'm disabling the sanity check in this case, although that's not ideal. The rewrite to dynamic configurations fixes this, as it is then fine to end up at an identical configuration.  Fixes #1400.  -- Change-Id: I466edaf3e1e1d9e9cc353e3937e6675f75c870fc Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/6618/ MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=136146249
