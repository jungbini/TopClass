  Find parent and submodule definitions before fully resolving a pom  The Maven API has two options for parsing pom files: getting the "raw model" (which parses the pom to ensure it is correct, but doesn't do any resolution nor variable substitution) and getting the "effective model," which does all resolution. Before this CL, generate_workspace was just getting the effective model immediately, which is easily foiled by having an artifact that depends on a "sibling" (the parent cannot be resolved until the siblings are and the siblings can only be resolved if they happen to arrive in the right order).  This changes the code to get the raw models first to get locations of all artifacts, then fully resolve them.  This fixes #383.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=101129094
