  Fix ThinLTO indexing linkstamp handling  We were including the linkstamp object file in the linker inputs on the command line for the LTO indexing step, despite not adding the linkstamp compile command or the files to the inputs and outputs, causing an error. The linkstamp file is not compiled in ThinLTO mode. The linkstamp is correctly added to the final native link.  The fix is to not pass the linkstampMap to the CppLinkVariablesExtension for the LTO indexing step. Passing in the map causes the linkstamp outputs to be added to the buildVariables, resulting in the outputs being added to the command line via the featureConfiguration.  Added linkstamps to several of the ThinLTO tests.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=136480400
