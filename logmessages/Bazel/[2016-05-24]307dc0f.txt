  workers: Improve verbose messages when workers are restarted. Prevent killing of broken workers in the background, when no build is currently running, because we can only alert the user about what's going on while a build is currently running.  If you're a developer, this will probably help you when debugging a new worker.  Some messages you might see with --worker_verbose specified:  INFO: Worker configuration has changed, restarting worker pool...  WARNING: Javac worker (id 6) can no longer be used, because its files have changed on disk [13ce6c10546243b6b4ea2334dd3f8a55705e4c078cedd0e746d7ad7cee082e9a -> 9731223c50bab5c1f20d60d1a4967cf2726840727b6a639b6f6425547a9b4a10].
