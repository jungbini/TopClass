  Do not add "indirect runfiles" to the tools of a ctx.action if it has an executable attribute (as opposed to a "command" attribute).  The current behavior will trigger unnecessary restarts of persistent workers. This fixes a bug reported to me, but has the potential to break something else, because the current behavior was actually introduced on purpose in https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/2260/.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=133115721
