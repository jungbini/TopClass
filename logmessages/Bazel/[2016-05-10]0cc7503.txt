  Release 0.2.3 (2016-05-10)  Baseline: 5a2dd7a  Incompatible changes:  - All repositories are now directly under the x.runfiles directory in the runfiles tree (previously, external repositories were at x.runfiles/main-repo/external/other-repo. This simplifies handling remote repository runfiles considerably, but will break existing references to external repository runfiles. Furthermore, if a Bazel project does not provide a workspace name in the WORKSPACE file, Bazel will now default to using __main__ as the workspace name (instead of "", as previously). The repository's runfiles will appear under x.runfiles/__main__/. - Bazel does not embed protocol buffer-related rules anymore. - It is now an error for a cc rule's includes attribute to point to the workspace root. - Bazel warns if a cc rule's includes attribute points out of third_party. - Removed cc_* attributes: abi / abi_deps. Use select() instead.  New features:  - select({"//some:condition": None }) is now possible (this "unsets" the attribute).  Important changes:  - java_import now allows its 'jars' attribute to be empty. - adds crunch_png attribute to android_binary - Replace --java_langtools, --javabuilder_top, --singlejar_top, --genclass_top, and --ijar_top with java_toolchain.{javac,javabuilder,singlejar,genclass,ijar} - External repository correctness fix: adding a new file/directory as a child of a new_local_repository is now noticed. - iOS apps are signed with get-task-allow=1 unless building with -c opt. - Generate debug symbols (-g) is enabled for all dbg builds of objc_ rules. - Bazel's workspace name is now io_bazel. If you are using Bazel's source as an external repository, then you may want to update the name you're referring to it as or you'll begin seeing warnings about name mismatches in your code. - Fixes integer overflow in J2ObjC sources to be Java-compatible. - A FlagPolicy specified via the --invocation_policy flag will now match the current command if any of its commands matches any of the commands the current command inherits from, as opposed to just the current command. - The key for the map to cc_toolchain_suite.toolchains is now a string of the form "cpu|compiler" (previously, it was just "cpu"). - Fix interaction between LIPO builds and C++ header modules. - Ctrl-C will now interrupt a download, instead of waiting for it to finish. - Proxy settings can now be specified in http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables (not just HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY). - Skylark targets can now read include directories from ObjcProvider. - Expose parameterized aspects to Skylark. - Support alwayslink cc_library dependencies in objc binaries. - Import cc_library dependencies in generated Xcode project.
