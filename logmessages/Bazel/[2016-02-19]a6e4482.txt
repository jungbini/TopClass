and commit ffc891c4efbf498fdb8eaf4d2c922e7e7a58f99d with additional fixes. In particular I have removed unnecessary properties from all rule attributes, have made the rule respect any runfiles, and have reinstanted the explicit dependency on the JDK.  The latter is what fixes the breakage we observed in #938, though it seems clear that we are missing a dependency somewhere.  I have verified that this now works by running this change on a clean Ubuntu 15.10 VM.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=115081830
