  Always register module map actions.  * Makes it so module map generation action will be registered for all targets that should provide module maps. This allows other rules to depend directly on modulemap artifacts without turning on --experimental_objc_enable_module_maps for all builds.  * Disabled module maps for apple_binary because of a bug.  * objc_proto_library targets will register module map generation even with experimental union flag so that its modules can be imported by the dependent targets (even though the compilation is happening much later in the linking target).
