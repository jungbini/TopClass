  Quick workaround for #473 that reenables hdrs_check in Bazel to unblock the release. Note the following peculiarities of the current situation:  - Sandboxed execution still silently falls back to non-sandboxed execution due to LocalGccStrategy explicitly requesting local execution. - However, builds are still correct due to local execution using hdrs_check. - hdrs_check, even though it was intended to default to "strict" in Bazel from the start, is still set to "loose" by default, so you might accidentally be using non-declared header files in your cc_* targets. In this case, your builds will break when the default becomes hdrs_check=strict and sandboxing becomes available. It is recommended that you check whether your builds are affected, by specifying --hdrs_check=strict manually and fixing your BUILD files to explicitly list all used includes in the srcs / hdrs attributes of your cc_* targets.  These remaining issues will be fixed in an upcoming change.  This change also adds regression tests for the issue.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=105747212
