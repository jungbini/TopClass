  Fix race condition in SkylarkType.of  Fix race condition in SkylarkType.of(), whereby .equals() but not same (==) types were created, by making Simple.of() synchronized.  Also make SkylarkType#includes() more robust by using .equals() instead of == (it's a little bit slower in the case of Simple types once fixed, but also works on complex types that don't hash-cons their values).  Also, distinguish SkylarkList (printed as list) and java.util.List (printed as List) and similarly for tuple vs Tuple, when printing types in debugging messages.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=87490176
