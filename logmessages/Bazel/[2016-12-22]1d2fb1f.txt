 + b11dd48: Fix bad bug with the parallel implementation of BinaryOperatorExpression. Turns out that ForkJoinTask#adapt(Callable) returns a ForkJoinTask whose Future#get on error throws a ExecutionException wrapping a RuntimeException wrapping the thrown checked exception from the callable. This is documented behavior [1] that I incorrectly didn't know about. + 9012bf1: Fix scripts/packages/convert_changelog to read the changelog correctly + 55c97bc: Release script: if master branch does not exist, fall back on origin/master + 4fb378c: Debian repository: override section and priority fields + acbcbc2: Fix release notes in emails + 4975760: Fix PathFragment to not use Java8-only static hashCode methods. + 05fd076: Disable sandboxing for XibCompile actions.  Incompatible changes:  - Skylark maven_jar and maven_aar settings attribute is now a label so it can be checked into your workspace. - --{no}experimental_use_rclass_generator is now a nop.  New features:  - Coverage support (*experimental*) for pure Java target. Use `bazel coverage //my:target` to generate coverage information from a `java_test`.  Important changes:  - Enable fallback URLs in Skylark http rules. - cc_proto_library generates C++ code from proto_library rules. - cc_library now supports the strip_prefix and strip_include_prefix attributes for control of include paths. - Skylark dicts internally don't rely on keys order anymore and accept any hashable values (i.e. structs with immutable values) as keys. Iteration order of dictionaries is no longer specified.
