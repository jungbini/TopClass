  fix bug in test-specific top-level artifact helper behavior  A recent change resulted in TopLevelArtifactHelper.getTopLevelArtifacts() returning an empty result when passed TopLevelArtifactContext.DEFAULT. This only happens in tests and wasn't caught because tests were never fully checking the results. Update MultiGroupForgeResourceAccountantTest to better consider/expose this failure and fixed.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=87254923
