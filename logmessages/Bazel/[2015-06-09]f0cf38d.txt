  Make it possible to put the Crosstool proto in BUILD files.  This is needed so that Bazel can access Android NDK if it's outside of the workspace. The current limitation is that we Bazel can pretend that there is a BUILD file there, but cannot do the same with a CROSSTOOL file. We could fix that limitation, but given that Crosstool is the only conceivable use case, let's fix it by changing the Blaze-Crosstool interface.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=95517408
