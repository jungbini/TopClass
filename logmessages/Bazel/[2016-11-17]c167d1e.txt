  Fix a javac-turbine tree pruning bug  When rewriting blocks to `{ throws new AssertionError(); }`, use a fully-qualified name for `java.lang.AssertionError` in case we're inside the declaration of a type with the same simple name.  Also, only add the throws expression statement when rewriting lambda body blocks, since that's the only place it matters.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=139397324
