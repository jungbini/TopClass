  Sets SONAME on shared objects in Android binaries.  Adds a linker flag to set the internal DT_SONAME. This fixes #1578 for SDK 24 and removes the warnings for previous SDKs. There is no need to set the linker flag for android_librarys that depend on native code, because the linker flag will be set by the android_binarys that depend on that android_library.  Testing is done via `readelf` executable that is shipped with the NDK.  -- Change-Id: I16fdfe6522c8694ce51554289122bf035a61d9ec Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/4302/ MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=129920256
