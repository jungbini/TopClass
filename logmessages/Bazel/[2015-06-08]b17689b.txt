  Log exceptions deserializing Packages  Due to our streaming deserialization approach we can leave data on the wire when encountering exceptions. Java serialization, the primary consumer of this code, isn't happy with that and throws an IllegalStateException("unread block data"), drowning out the original exception and leaving us without much useful debug information.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=95442892
