  Release 0.1.2 (2015-11-20)  Baseline: ee0ade3 + 1e66ccd: RELNOTES: Symlink dirents of directories containing a file named "DONT_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS_WHEN_TRAVERSING_THIS_DIRECTORY_VIA _A_RECURSIVE_TARGET_PATTERN" will *not* be traversed for transitive target patterns. The motivation here is to allow directories that intentionally contain wonky symlinks (e.g. foo/bar -> foo) to opt out of being consumed by Blaze. For example, given + f5773fc: Set the ijar MAX_BUFFER_SIZE to 256 MB  New features:  - java_library now supports the proguard_specs attribute for passing Proguard configuration up to Android (not Java) binaries. - http_file can specify "executable" to make the downloaded file runnable. - Debian and tar packaging is now supported (see tools/build_defs/pkg/README.md). - cpxx_builtin_include_directory specifications allow more flexibility. - accept %crosstool_top% in cxx_builtin_include_directory - android_binary now supports proguard_apply_mapping to re-use a previously generated proguard mapping.  Important changes:  - remove webstatusserver (--use_webstatusserver). - Add support for objc textual headers, which will not be compiled when modules are enabled. - actoolzip, momczip and swiftstdlibtoolzip have all been made into bash scripts and have been renamed to actoolwrapper, momcwrapper and swiftstdlibtoolwrapper respectively. The old versions will be deleted in a later change. - [rust] Add rust_bench_test and rust_doc_test rules and improve usability of rust_test tule. - Java rules now support a resource_strip_prefix attribute that allows the removal of path prefixes from Java resources. - [docker_build] incremental loading is default now. Specify explicitly //package:target.tar (with the .tar extension) to obtain the full image. - --ios_signing_cert_name allows specifying a cert for iOS app signing - Go rules for Bazel. - [jsonnet] Update to Jsonnet 0.8.1. - [jsonnet] Add vars and code_vars attributes to jsonnet_to_json to allow passing external variables to Jsonnet via --var and --code_var. - Adds --override_workspace_root blaze flag to hand-set workspace_root and mainGroup in xcodeproj. - Allow dots in package names. - When used as a forwarding rule (i.e., has no sources), android_library will also forward any exported_plugins in its dependencies. - Add support for Windows-created zip files with non-posix permissions. - [jsonnet] Add jsonnet_to_json_test rule for testing Jsonnet code. - C++ compile actions run in a sandbox now on systems that support sandboxed execution. - The names of the clang compilers in the Android NDK crosstool no longer reference gcc. - 420 dpi is now a valid density for andoid_binary.densities. - Bazel does strict validation of include files now to ensure correct incremental builds. If you see compilation errors when building C++ code, please make sure that you explicitly declare all header files in the srcs or hdrs attribute of your cc_* targets and that your cc_* targets have correct "deps" on cc_library's that they use. - [jsonnet] Fix jsonnet_to_json rule to read code_vars from code_vars instead of vars. - Tests, genrules, and Skylark actions without the "requires-network" tag will no longer be able to access the network. - C++ libraries no longer need includes = ["."] (or similar copts) to include paths relative to a remote repository's root. - Support exports attribute for android_library - Symlink dirents of directories containing a file named "DONT_FOLLOW_SYMLINKS_WHEN_TRAVERSING_THIS_DIRECTORY_VIA_A_RECURSI VE_TARGET_PATTERN" will *not* be traversed for transitive target patterns. The motivation here is to allow directories that intentionally contain wonky symlinks (e.g. foo/bar -> foo) to opt out of being consumed by Blaze.
