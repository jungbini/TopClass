  Temporary fix for xcode project generation  The xcodegen script does not yet handle looking for files under @bazel_tools correctly. This change will let xcode find these targets under the workspace root, instead of the @bazel_tools repository. Note that this means that the package path must include third_party/java/j2objc if it does not exist in your workspace.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=114268000
