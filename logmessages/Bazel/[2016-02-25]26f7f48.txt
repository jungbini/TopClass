  Testing correct invalidation of Skylark Remote Repositories  A Skylark remote repository should be invalidated only when the WORKSPACE file change, or one of its dependency or the Skylark file change.  This change include two fixes: - The path of the RepositoryDirectoryValue was incorrect when the directory root is a symlink and the repository is not local (and not refetching). This was never triggered before because the only rule that were symlinking their root were the local one. - Directories were unitialized for the SkylarkRepositoryFunction (was forgotten as part of a refactor when introducing it).  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=115547540
