  Replace grep by expect_log in java_integration_test#test_java_plugin  This fixes #1888: on my laptop (Mac Book Air), the test is highly flaky (6-7 tests fails out of 10) but with this change, I observe no failures. I cannot explains it but it seems to be some kind of race in the stream handling.  -- Change-Id: I09eb9d5a1c8468c7a0299966a5ea20e7a5fc86f0 Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/c/6696/ MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=136459264
