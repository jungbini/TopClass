  fix some references to "Blaze" in BugReport.java  This patch replaces the usage of hardcoded "Blaze" string by Constants.PRODUCT_NAME, so when presenting the output to the user in the open source version, it says "Bazel" instead of "Blaze", as "Blaze" is the internal name of the tool and "Bazel" the public one.
