  Bazel client, Windows: implement pipe handling  Create WindowsPipe which implements IPipe, and is a Windows-native implementation of pipe handling. It wraps the ::CreatePipe, ::WriteFile, and ::ReadFile API functions.  Start using WindowsPipe on MSYS.  Also move everything from file_test.cc into file_posix_test.cc, because these test methods heavily depend on POSIX and they test file_posix's functionality anyway.  Also add tests for pipes: this will use the platform-specific implementation of IPipe. file_test.cc is now platform-independent, and we can test it with --cpu=x64_windows_msvc (and it passes!).
