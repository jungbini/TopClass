  blaze_util_windows: use some widechar Win32 API  In this change: - implement PrintErrorW (copy of PrintError but uses FormatMessageW) - use GetModuleFileNameW in GetSelfPath and do not worry about UNC paths, we'll automatically handle them in the future when we use widechar functions everywhere. Until then, if a path happens to have the "\\?\" prefix and that causes an error, we won't be worse off than today; today we just call `pdie` - use GetTempPathW in GetOutputRoot; in theory this might also return an UNC path but again that shouldn't be a problem - add comments for the arguments of CreateFileA and CreateProcessA calls, to make the code a bit more readable  See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2181  -- PiperOrigin-RevId: 142118854 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=142118854
