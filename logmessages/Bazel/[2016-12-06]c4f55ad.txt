  *** Reason for rollback ***  Rollforward with fixes to android_integration_test.sh. The test now uses the new syntax for the Support Library AARs.  All CIs that have been created since last December should have this library installed due to https://github.com/bazelbuild/continuous-integration/blob/master/mac/mac-android.sh#L36.  *** Original change description ***  Automated [] rollback of commit f699b502ef6a57dc68570486191ad1c318e8fd1b.  *** Reason for rollback ***  Breaks android_integration_test.sh which relies on the old targets.  I don't have time to update the test to use the new targets at the moment, so rolling the change back for now.  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2159  RELNOTES:  -- PiperOrigin-RevId: 141233182 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=141233182
