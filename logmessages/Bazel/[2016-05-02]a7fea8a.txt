  Set workspace name for http_file, http_jar, and maven_jar  Fixes #1166.  While I was here, I also:  * Renamed the implementations of Decompressor to show that they are Decompressors, not SkyFunctions (they used to be, it's confusing to have them still have the -Function suffix). * Added a unit test and moved the testing target to the rule/repository subdirectory, since it was a good chance to break off a tiny chunk of the monolithic BUILD file in lib/.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=121306165
