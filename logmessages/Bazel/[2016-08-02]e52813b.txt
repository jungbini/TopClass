  ExperimentalStateTracker: make suffix gracefully handle negative length  When requested to produce a suffix of a string of a string of a given length, gracefully handle the case where the requested length is negative---simply return the empty string in this case. While there, mark this static method as such; also increase visibility to default as it is generally useful and should be tested as an interface of this class.  -- Change-Id: I821966f7ba3828809bc6d000358803c131740ec9 Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/4223 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=129080284
