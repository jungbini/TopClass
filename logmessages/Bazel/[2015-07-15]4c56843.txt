  Move Jack's tools into AndroidSdkProvider.  This also eliminates the JackRule, which is no longer necessary, as its sole purpose was to allow Jack's tools to be found. This is now part of AndroidSdkProvider, like all other Android tools.  For now, the new attributes on android_sdk are optional and default to their old values. In the future, the new attributes will become mandatory with no defaults, like the other attributes on that rule.  Also fixes a bug where errors found during AndroidCommon.initJava would not result in a null return from init, previously obscured by the early return from initJack.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=98305022
