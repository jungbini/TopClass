  *** Reason for rollback ***  This change causes android_integration_test failing on Mac.  *** Original change description ***   Sets SONAME on shared objects in Android binaries.  Adds a linker flag to set the internal DT_SONAME. This fixes #1578 for SDK 24 and removes the warnings for previous SDKs. There is no need to set the linker flag for android_librarys that depend on native code, because the linker flag will be set by the android_binarys that depend on that android_library.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=129074607
