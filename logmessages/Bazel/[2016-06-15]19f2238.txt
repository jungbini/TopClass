  Fix hypothetical crash bug in AspectDefinition#addAllAttributesOfAspect when the default value of a parameterized aspect attribute is null. This is hypothetical because I couldn't figure out an end-to-end way to tickle the bug. Still, the surrounding code is very brittle and things may change in the future such that the bug is trivially tickle-able.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=124977450
