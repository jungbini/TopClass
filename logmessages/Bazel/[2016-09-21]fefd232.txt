  Use nanosleep(2) instead of poll(2) to sleep.  Starting with macOS Sierra developer beta 4, the behavior of poll(2) was changed, such that poll(2) will return immediately regardless the timeout if there is no file descriptor.  This fixes #1767. And, this should be a better solution for Homebrew/homebrew-core#5041.  Closes #1803.  -- Reviewed-on: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/1803 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=133816294
