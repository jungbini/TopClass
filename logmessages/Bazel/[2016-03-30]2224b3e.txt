  Only break lines if cursor motion is in use  Manual breaking lines was introduced in a49f0253 to ensure Bazel knows the number of lines written, so the correct number of lines can be erased when the progress bar is updated. As this is only an issue if curses are in use, that wrapping as only added to the FancyTerminalEventHandler. However, Bazel distinguishes between two uses of curses - curses to add color to the output, and - curses to control the cursor and erase outdated progress bars. If the former is used, but not the latter, it is not necessary to wrap lines; in fact, not doing so is more backwards compatible while still keeping the line-eating bug fixed. So don't break lines in this case.  -- Change-Id: Ieef8ab9410a071c35609a395f45cd56653115426 Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3170 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=118587980
