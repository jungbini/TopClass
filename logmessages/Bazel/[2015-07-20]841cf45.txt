  Make --android_crosstool_top default to the android_ndk_repository specified in the WORKSPACE file.  The error reporting if an android_ndk_repository rule is present is not very user-friendly (it just uses the non-Android toolchain, resulting in compile errors) but given that --android_crosstool_top is an interim solution until we get reasonable multi-platform support, I suppose it's fine.  As a side effect, instead of prefixing fat APK output directories with "fat-apk-", we prefix Android output directories with "android-".  This makes it possible to build Android apps with zero command line options. Rejoice!  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=98624120
