  workers: A multitude of bug fixes and improved logging.  I know this should have been split up, but I was a bit on fire today and did it all in one go ^^;  Fixes spurious "Stream closed: Stream closed" errors, by noticing dead workers and retrying with a fresh one. (Configurable with the --worker_max_retries flag.)  Fixes an "IllegalArgumentException" when a non-worker compatible Spawn is given to the strategy. We fall back to StandaloneSpawnStrategy now.  Redirect the stderr of worker processes to separate log files in a common sub-directory and print a message that tells you about the location on worker start-up for easier debugging. The log can be found in <output_base>/worker-logs/*.log.  Adds the mnemonic of the Spawn to log messages and the log filename.  Adds verbose messages on worker start-up and shutdown. (Enable it with --worker_verbose!)  Shuts down the worker pool after a build finished by default, until we sort out one last remaining correctness issue. This also conserves resources, though makes incremental builds a bit slower. Want the maximum performance anyway? Try --experimental_workers_keep_running.  Adds stack traces to errors that are caused by buggy workers to aid development.  Fixes weird dupli..tripli..quadruple error messages ("Compiling failed: Stream closed: Stream closed: Stream closed: Stream closed.").  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=102983853
