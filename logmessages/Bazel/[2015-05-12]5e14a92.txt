  Support --objc_generate_debug_symbols when --ios_multi_cpus is set.  When an ios_application is built, Bazel now collects the .breakpad files for each architecture and tweaks the first line of each file to reflect the name of the app, instead of the name of the binary:  MODULE mac arm64 5A70922132B738E194DDBC456F90F43F0 PrenotCalculatorBinary_bin becomes MODULE mac arm64 5A70922132B738E194DDBC456F90F43F0 PrenotCalculator  Bazel also correctly renames the files to end with their architecture, so that the crash server can use them:  armv7/.../PrenotCalculatorBinary.breakpad becomes PrenotCalculator_armv7.breakpad  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=93419816
