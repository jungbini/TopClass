  docker_build: workaround the lack of LZMA in python 2.7  Some debs file actually does use the LZMA compression and reading that format requires python 3. Backports of LZMA to python 2 are using native deps which might be hard for the user to setup and our support of python 3 is not really functional (it needs 2to3 to use gflags for instance). Until we fix Bazel's python 3 support, we shell out to xzcat for supporting LZMA compressed file.  Also added test for the archive library. These tests shows some wrong handling in the AR format padding, fixed.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=100474498
