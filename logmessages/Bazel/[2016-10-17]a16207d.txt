  Failing back to --expunge when using --expunge_async on non-Linux machine  --expunge_async rely on setsid to create a new process group, this is non-existent on Darwin nor on Windows.

Instead, we fall-back to expunge_async until we completely fixes #1906.  -- Change-Id: Ia932613f687149a85f766de9faa7ce49aaa20b38 Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/6694 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=136340995
