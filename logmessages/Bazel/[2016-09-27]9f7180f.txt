  Bootstrapping: don't use convenience symlinks  When `compile.sh` builds bazel using bazel, it copies the resulting binary to `output/bazel`. However sometimes the convenience symlink `bazel-bin` is not created, probably because an old one is still around and cannot be deleted.  That is clearly a bug, but to work around it, the bootstrap builder shouldn't attempt to rely on the creation of these symlinks in the first place.  This change updates compile.sh to use `bazel info` to locate the `bazel-bin` directory's real path, and attempt to copy the bazel binary from there.
