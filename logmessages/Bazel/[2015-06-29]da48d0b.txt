  Remove references to all Android tools from AndroidConfiguration.  Bazel unconditionally loads all the labels in configurations for now, and we don't want Android stuff to be loaded if the build doesn't have anything to do with Android. The alternative would be to fix this by not loading all configuration fragments, but this is the more expedient solution.  The SDK will be dealt with by binding //external:android/sdk to a dummy SDK unless overridden by an android_sdk_repository rule.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=97116824
