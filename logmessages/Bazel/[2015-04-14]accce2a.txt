  Improves the method xcodegen uses to find the workspace root  This fixes an issue where xcodegen would generate .xcodeproj files that could not successfully be built by Xcode or xcodebuild. The issue was that the method used to find the workspace root was based on path-traversal logic starting on a file that was in bazel's directory. This resulted in an incorrect workspace root for projects that were not sharing a workspace with bazel itself.  The new code finds a source file in the target list, takes its absolute path, and then walks up a directory for each path segment in its relative path. It uses the result as the workspace root.  -- Change-Id: Id32eea56c8cc07289fce4e94046872552abeb416 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=91095436
