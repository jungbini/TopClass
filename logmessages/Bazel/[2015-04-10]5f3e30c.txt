  Simplify Skylark tests  Use the new EvaluationContext infrastructure to simplify Skylark tests (said infrastructure is originally based on code from these tests).  Merge AbstractEvaluationTestCase and AbstractParserTestCase into a non-abstract class EvaluationTestCase that uses EvaluationContext. Cleanup the EventCollectionApparatus it uses. Refactor all Skylark tests to use this new infrastructure. Fix EvaluationTest and MethodLibraryTest to actually and correctly run tests in both modes.  Fix small bugs in the main code base discovered by actually running the code in both modes, and make error messages identical when possible.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=90828053
