  Introduce a seperate name to distinguish the objc provider passed from native rules to skylark rules and that returned from skylark rules to depending native rules.  This fixes a bug where a skylark rule that did not touch the objc provider would automatically pass up the objc provider it received from dependencies to dependant native rules, leading to duplicate symbol linking errors when the same objc provider was exported twice.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=118947782
