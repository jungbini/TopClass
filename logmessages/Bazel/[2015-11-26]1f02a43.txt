  This change fixes a mysterious timeout when the Maven tests fail.  I have no idea why this is a problem: apparently, postincrement fails (but only the first one, so theoretically, changing only that line would be enough), preincrement works and i=$(( $i + 1 )) also works. The documentation of bash is of no help, I checked the file on the off chance that there are weird Unicode characters on that line (or where i is set) and I had no more ideas after (other than there being a bug in bash)  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=108774915
