  Fix bug in ParallelEvaluator when an error dep was not newly requested in a nokeep_going build because it finished building in between the time it was first requested and when we checked it for done-ness after the SkyFunction evaluation.  This results in an IllegalStateException that gets ignored (and, importantly, not propagated) by AbstractQueueVisitor because AbstractQueueVisitor only records and propagates the first Throwable encountered. For nokeep_going evaluations, this will be the SchedulerException that we use for control flow. The IllegalStateException in question is benign in this case because it's merely from a Preconditions failure and doesn't leave anything in a bad state. It's possible, though, that we have other bugs that are being masked in this way.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=129919336
