  Add an option for the number of actions shown in the experimental UI  Currently, the experimental UI always shows the 3 oldest, still running actions. While this seems a reasonable default, some users requested to be able to change the number of actions shown. Hence replace the hard-coded value by a flag.  While there, also fix an off-by-one error in deciding when to put the ellipsis symbol.  -- Change-Id: I037d208360fa1d3f100c99ab1ab1f5fc140138ac Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3811 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=125427168
