  java_binary: fix runfiles dir creation on Windows  Create the runfiles directory for the shell stub script (bazel-bin/foo/bar_bin and bazel-bin/foo/bar_bin.runfiles) but use the batch script as the runfiles provider's executable (bazel-bin/foo/bar_bin.cmd). This way we the shell stub script can still find its runfiles (under its parent directory + its base name + ".runfiles) while "bazel run" can also work on Windows.
