  Make project generated by setup-intellij.sh error-free.  Fix three issues, one cosmetic, with setup-intellij.sh: running bazel query "deps(${target}, 1)" on generated java files with a visibility specification was returning two targets, one of which was the visibility. Filtering for rules fixes that.  Bazel uses the javac langtools in third_party/ in preference to the SDK's, but that wasn't reflected in the order of dependencies in the module. This requires a small hack, since the SDK should appear before some other jars in the dependencies.  Finally, remove some apparently dead code related to ijar that was just printing errors when the script was run.  -- Change-Id: Iba5ae5a46c720282d99f193cd098ea14cc5eef52 Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/2990 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=115246698
