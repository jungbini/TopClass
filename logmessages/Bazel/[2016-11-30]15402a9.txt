  New features:  - android_library now has a "exported_plugins" attribute just like java_library - Use --strict_system_includes to apply hdrs_check=strict also to cc_library.includes, even if sandboxing is disabled. - Bazel on Windows: java_binary can now be the executable of Skylark rule actions (ctx.action's executable argument) - Packages are defined in BUILD.bazel as well as BUILD files.  Important changes:  - getattr()'s 3-arg form no longer raises an error when the retrieved field is a built-in method. - --apk_signing_method default changed to v1. Android APKs are now signed with the new ApkSignerTool by default. - New rule: proto_lang_toolchain(), to support LANG_proto_library rules on multiple platforms. - Fix for Android clang++ std::stack segfault on 32bit x86. See https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=220159 - Default android_manifest_merger is now "android" which uses the official Android manifest merger. http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide/man ifest-merger - Do not propagate aspect to its own attributes when using '*'. - Comparing sets (`if set1 < set2:`) is not allowed anymore in Skylark because it didn't work correctly anyway. - When --experimental_extra_action_top_level_only, Bazel reports extra-actions for actions registered by Aspects injected by a top-level rule (approximately). - Blacklists for proto_lang_toolchain() no longer have to be proto_library's. - Extra actions now contain aspect-related information. - Fix slicing bug where "abc"[:-4:-1] would give wrong answer
