  *** Reason for rollback ***  Breaks targets. See []  Manually verified this unbreaks the target mentioned in the bug.  *** Original change description ***  Do not compile source files mentioned in 'hdrs'.  Currently for a library: cc_library(name='a', hdrs=['a.cc']) we compile a.cc into a.pic.o and link that into its reverse dependencies.  With this change, a .cc file in hdrs will be treated like a .inc file or a file in textual_hdrs.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=113568452
