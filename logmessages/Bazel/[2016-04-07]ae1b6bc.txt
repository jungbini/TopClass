where a less specific option specification in a rc file could override a more specific option specification when there's a non-trivial Command hierarchy. A concrete example would be a "build --foo=1" line overriding a "test --foo=2" line for a "test" invocation.  See the added test for more details.  Also fix some typos in BlazeCommandDispatcherRcoptionsTest.java.  Note that commit dc0fbb42ab22ab8f3205b0884069e1ffe03677c9 was rolled back in commit 417dad0f1e0d0ed4ccd5f8e52b49eb79937da49d which also incidentally rolled back commit 4f0fbe1b09333806cce76b75214e98c7684766e0. So this change is effectively a roll-forward of both of those, plus the bug fix, plus the typo fixes, and plus a documentation update.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=119276218
