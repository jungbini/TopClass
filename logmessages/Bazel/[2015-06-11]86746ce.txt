  Fix permissions for zip files  Now [new_]http_archive can be used for executables as well as "default permission" (644) files.  This also gets rid of the Apache Commons Compress dependency entirely, which is nice. Fixing this also exposed some bugs in how archives were being decompressed (the same archive was being decompressed multiple times), which I also fixed by making the decompressors SkyFunctions.  Fixes #238.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=95747810
