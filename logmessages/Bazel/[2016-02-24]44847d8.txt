  Enable access to file values in repository context  ctx.path now works with labels. When given a label, ctx.path() will returns the path to the corresponding file if the label point to a file, or error out if it does not point to file.  Also fix a small case with repository_ctx.symlink that wasn't creating its directories.  This is needed to enable reading template files to create a template function (see http://goo.gl/fD4ZsY) for issue #893 (step 4 of http://goo.gl/OZV3o0).  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=115438400
