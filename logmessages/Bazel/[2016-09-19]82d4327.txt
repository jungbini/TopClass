  Change execution root for external repositories to be ../repo  Some of the important aspect of this change:  * Remote repos in the execution root are under output_base/execroot/repo_name, so the prefix is ../repo_name (to escape the local workspace name). * Package roots for external repos were previously "output_base/", they are now output_base/external/repo_name (which means source artifacts always have a relative path from their repository). * Outputs are under bazel-bin/external/repo_name/ (or similarly under genfiles). Note that this is a bit of a change from how this was implemented in the previous cl.  Fixes #1262.  RELNOTES[INC]: Previously, an external repository would be symlinked into the execution root at execroot/local_repo/external/remote_repo. This changes it to be at execroot/remote_repo. This may break genrules/Skylark actions that hardcode execution root paths. If this causes breakages for you, ensure that genrules are using $(location :target) to access files and Skylark rules are using http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/lib/File.html's path, dirname, etc. functions.
