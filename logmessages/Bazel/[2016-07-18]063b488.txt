  Sort the results returned by the HybridGlobber if we are using results from Skyframe globbing. This adds a log(n) factor to uses of globs, but getting globs to be returned in a reasonable order that can be emulated by legacy globbing is hard and bug-prone right now, and we must sort anyway if we are merging legacy and Skyframe globs.  Note that this log(n) factor is already present on clean builds with legacy globbing. If we end up seeing performance issues on incremental loading, we can investigate making GlobFunction efficiently return elements in sorted order. (We would still need to sort if merging legacy and Skyframe globs, but that should be a relatively rare occurrence, and can be dealt with by a more efficient merge sort if necessary.)  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=127752554
