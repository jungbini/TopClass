  Sets SONAME on shared objects in Android binaries.  Adds a linker flag to set the internal DT_SONAME. This fixes #1578 for SDK 24 and removes the warnings for previous SDKs. There is no need to set the linker flag for android_librarys that depend on native code, because the linker flag will be set by the android_binarys that depend on that android_library.  -- Change-Id: If6422f2c2677ec974a3682e3038d7fe159ed4978 Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/4210/ MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=128833820
