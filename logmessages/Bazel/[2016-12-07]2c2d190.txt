  Pass isExternal field to blaze ide info proto  Roll forward after fixing tests. Changes from rolled-back CL:  Native aspect now determines 'isExternal' identically to skylark aspect. RepositoryName.isMain was unreliable (at least in testing environment), because unknown repos (occurring due to some race condition) are flagged as being in the 'default' repo, distinct from the 'main' repo.  We now bypass RepositoryName entirely, and use the same label string heuristic as used in the Skylark aspect.  -- PiperOrigin-RevId: 141314075 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=141314075
