  Canonicalize the name of the target itself for java indirect dep errors.  Roll-forward of I3762e6be911b79a133a2959fce3a8bf34d183232 with fixes.  Otherwise it prints the wrong message when the target which is missing a dependency is in a repository other than the default one.  Second try with the new test disabled for jdk7 because that uses an old, fixed version of the code.  -- Change-Id: I7e16fa874066e1b63064662df42a98784fcae233 Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3032/ MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=116248259
