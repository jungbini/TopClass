  *** Reason for rollback ***  The sandbox fix did not fix. More work is needed.  Fixes #1239  *** Original change description ***  Automated [] rollback of commit b4549fe8dfb29f87fd37b38bf21a5b4bef818b12.  *** Reason for rollback ***  Rollforward with fixes: - Quote single-quote in the environment exports - Exclude the following environment variables: _ and dotted names - Add the wrapper to the dependency of the crosstool chain so it gets shipped to the sandbox.  Hopefully after that we can cut a new release and have a homebrew package again #1177.  *** Original change description ***  Automated [] rollback of commit f1f24fc4b5aa83b7a4b872ec8f1c3a369799c081.  *** Reason...  ***  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=121665313
