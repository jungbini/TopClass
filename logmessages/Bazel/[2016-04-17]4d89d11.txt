  Fix SkyQuery bug where we weren't respecting the package blacklist. We do this by changing both the relevant Skyframe and the SkyQuery code to propagate (minimal!) blacklist information in the SkyKeys themselves.  There are other approaches to solving this problem, but I like how this solution doesn't involve duplication of logic. Also, it has the following nice benefit: previously, RecursiveDirectoryTraversalFunction would declare a dep on the blacklist for every directory traversed which adds an edge for each directory traversed.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=120049635
