  Refactor action output dumping to go through a single method.  This is in preparation for moving the output dumping to the Reporter for two reasons: - we're currently relying on there being a Reporter which locks on itself; i.e., this code is tightly coupled with the Reporter code - the current Blaze output is confusing; we first print an info event, then the actual output, and then an error event - putting the Reporter in control allows us to fix that  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=112240684
