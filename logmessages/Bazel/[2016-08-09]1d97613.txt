  ProxyHelper handles proxy URLs with trailing slash.  Having a proxy URL defined with a trailing slash caused an exception. `Proxy address ... is not a valid URL"` This pull request fixes this issue.  I also added two test cases for this issue. 1. Trailing slash in proxy URL. 2. No user:password provided in proxy URL.    Closes #1597.  -- Reviewed-on: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/1597 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=129721433
