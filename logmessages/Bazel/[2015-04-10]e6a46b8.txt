  Allow evaluation from String  Lift the Evaluation code from the test files AbstractParserTestCase and AbstractEvaluationTestCase into new files EvaluationContext. Remove this code's dependency on FsApparatus (and thus to InMemoryFS), by making the Lexer accept null as filename. Also remove dependency on EventCollectionApparatus; parameterized by an EventHandler.  Have the SkylarkSignatureProcessor use this Evaluation for defaultValue-s.  While refactoring evaluation, have SkylarkShell use it, which fixes its ValidationEnvironment issues.  TODO: refactor the tests to use this new infrastructure.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=90824736
