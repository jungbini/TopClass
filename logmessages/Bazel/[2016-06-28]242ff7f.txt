  Canonicalize some TransitiveTraversalValue objects -- those corresponding to error-free built-in rules, and to non-rules. This should save memory, as well as CPU for built-in rules, since we don't have to make sets out of their providers more than once.  Also fix a bug in the equality check where we weren't comparing the canHaveAnyProvider field properly.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=126121351
