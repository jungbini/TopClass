  *** Reason for rollback ***  The underlying issue (wrong operator '==' instead of '=' for test (a.k.a '[')) was fixed by commit 31b059fc07831f86be951609128b7cd51613df98 which removed the offending code completely.  *** Original change description ***  Revert build-runfiles to use /bin/bash  If /bin/sh is dash (default on Ubuntu), this output a lot of garbage error, which make thing that the dummy build-runfiles is incorrect.
