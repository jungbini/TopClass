  Fix extra_actions with sandboxing.  The ExtraAction code assumed that it didn't need to list the runfiles of its tools when running locally, but this isn't true with sandboxing.  I don't think fixing this will negatively affect anybody's performance because they probably don't have any runfiles because they currently can't use them, unless they're running actions remotely in which case this change has no effect.  -- Change-Id: Ibeb3db9d31321912a7163d1bce0edf5f6288ea3e Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/2520/ MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=112670586
