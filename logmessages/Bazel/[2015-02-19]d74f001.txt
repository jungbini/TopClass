  Port all module map and header parsing related flags to the new crosstool configuration.  Together with [] (change to the crosstool configuration), the resulting blaze is able to build header modules (minus clang bugs).  Detailed changes: 1. Adapt CppCompileAction to only insert the arguments itself if the crosstool does not specify a feature. 2. Make CppCompileAction provide the build variables to the flag expansion. 3. Pass package features through to the new feature selection / crosstool configuration; allow rules to always request features and mark features as unsupported. 4. Add feature "header_module_includes_dependencies" that controls whether we can only provide top-level header modules in the ${module_files} build variable; the currently integrated clang does not fully support that yet. 5. Add feature "use_header_modules", which allows targets to use compiled header modules without being compilable as module themselves. 6. Convert tests to use the feature configuration where it makes sense; we will be able to delete a lot of unit tests once the control via the feature configuration is rolled out to the stable crosstool, and implement them as crosstool integration tests.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=86680884
