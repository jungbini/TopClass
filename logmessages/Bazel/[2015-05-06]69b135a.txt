  Combine pathTo{Digest,Bytes} in SingleBuildFileCache  Instead of updating the file size cache as a side effect of updating the digest cache we combine them into one cache to make it harder for them to fall out of sync (mainly by way of programmer error). This should also have a smaller memory footprint.  Also fixes a bug around cached exceptions.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=92928216
