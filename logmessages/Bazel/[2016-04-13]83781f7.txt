  Fixes bugs so that we can build bazel with bazel on Windows  src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/exec/SymlinkTreeHelper.java: enable --windows_compatible flag on Windows to make build-runfiles.exe work. scritps/bootstrap/compile.sh: --windows_compatible will also be passed to a dummy build-runfiles.exe defined in complie.sh. Which is actully a batch script, modify it to make it work.  ----- With the changes above, we are able to build bazel with bazel. But when you try to run ./compile.sh compile /path/to/bazel again without clean up tmp directory, it will fail with a permission deny error. The reason seems to be that you can't use build-runfile.exe to build the same hard link twice, still trying to solve that.  -- Change-Id: I93340b1ba9fa415f6db963b106e264799e33ede3 Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3334 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=119751076
