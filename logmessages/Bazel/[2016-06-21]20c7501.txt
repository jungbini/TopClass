  Parallelize (some of) BinaryOperatorExpression  Adds evalConcurrently to QueryExpression so that expression implementations that support concurrent evaluation can do so using the supplied executor service.  Implements concurrent evaluation for the PLUS/UNION cases of BinaryOperatorExpression.  Because evalConcurrently requires its callback to be threadsafe, but the callback passed to evaluateQuery may only be called by one thread at a time, this change makes the BatchStreamedCallback constructed by SkyQueryEnvironment threadsafe, including its uniquifier.  However, there is a thread-safety problem when the operands of BinaryOperatorExpression are LetExpressions, because their evaluation involves mutating state in the query environment. A future change will fix that. For now, concurrent evaluation is only attempted when the query expression is a BinaryOperatorExpression and all its operands are target literals.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=125505247
