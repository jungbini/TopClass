  Bazel documentation update, mainly for Windows  This change: - Updates the Installation page with instructions for Windows. Until now those were on the dedicated Windows page, but now for sake of consistency with other instructions for platforms, we have everything on one page.  - Adds notes about Chocolatey and links to the relevant maintenance page.  - Updates the Windows requirements page, removes duplicate information.  - Updates the left-side navigation pane making the Installation menu collapsible, adding the Windows-specific pages as submenu items  - Updates the Copyright message in page footers, fixes some typos, fixes broken links.
