  *** Reason for rollback ***  Roll-forward with appropriate fixes: --action_env is a "build" option, not a "common" option. Moreover, also inherit the corresponding variables for tests from the effective action environment.  Also fix the corresponding error in the design document.  *** Original change description ***  Automated [] rollback of commit 96d46280bc5a4803ba2242a4ad16939f85a3b212.  *** Reason for rollback ***  Broke installation on latest release.  Fixes #1846  *** Original change description ***   Reintroduce .bazelrc and set --action_env defaults  Shipping a .bazelrc was removed in 009b48bcfaf4ebb17f9ab03bea9036cfa3c12ff0. However, as per our "Specifying environment variables for actions" design document, we want to ship a global rc file specifying the common environment variables to be inherited. So revert that change and add the desired entries to the global bazelrc file we're shipping.  ***  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=134769063
