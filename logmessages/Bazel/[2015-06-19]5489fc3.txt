  Stop "no generating action" exceptions for configurable cc_library "srcs". The underlying problem is that Bazel determines whether or not to generate a .so by the contents of "srcs", but this happens in the loading phase before configurations are known. So, when "srcs" is configurable, it conservatively assumes a .so needs to be generated.  In cc_library analysis, when the final values for "srcs" is properly bound, the .so may not actually be needed after all.  This cl fixes the discrepancy by registering a FailAction for the .so under those circumstances - we don't actually need the .so anywhere but we still have to ensure it's registered with an owning action.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=96405079
