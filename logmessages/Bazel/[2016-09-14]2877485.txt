 Use inheritance to support site-specific options. * commit dfb2c73eda3d2dd8787ea9b2d0a03b49dfa2acc5: Inject the product name via the per-product main.cc files. * unknown commit: Remove the internal/external startup_options duality.  The cause that triggered the rollbacks was fixed separately in commit 69a8d7205287bedf3a6140ec9327e2fad1758c22 as prepartory work for this roll-forward, so things should work now.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=133139218
