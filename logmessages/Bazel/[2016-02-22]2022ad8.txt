  Fix blatant bug with Skyframe globbing where we incorrectly allow dangling symlinks to match a glob pattern.  This bug has/had two consequences:  (1) Change pruning will incorrectly cut off changes to GlobValues that ought to now match more files (say, if a dangling symlink comes into existence), causing a package to be incorrectly incrementally not re-loaded.  (2) After a recent change to PackageFunction where we use a fancy hybrid globbing approach, we use skyframe globbing on incremental package loading. So if a re-loaded package has the same glob pattern but this glob pattern incorrectly matches a dangling symlink, the re-loaded package will incorrectly have a target for the dangling symlink path.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=115274842
