  Make load() work in remote repositories too.  Previously, load() always looked up .bzl files in the main repository. Ideally, it would just take a label and then it would work by default, but for the time being, this quick fix will do.  I had to put in an evil hack to make load() statements work in the prelude, because we currently have no way to distinguish load() statements from the prelude and from the BUILD file. Again, a proper label-based load() would solve this.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=101677502
