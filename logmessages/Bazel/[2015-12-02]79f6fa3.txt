  Update Rust new_http_archive rules to use 1.4 and strip_prefix  The lack of strip_prefix lead to the files not being found with the supplied rust.BUILD file.  Tested: - created simple repository with rust_library and rust_binary targets as outlined in //tools/build_rules/rust/README.md - (workaround) copied //tools/build_rules/rust/rust.BUILD into workspace as suggested by @kchodorow: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/488#issuecomment-143754576 - verified that library and binary build, and that binary runs correctly  RELNOTES: Update Rust to 1.4  -- Change-Id: Ic2c275395ca245179e35e723faf0b9d13120fa1f Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/2382/ MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=109187409
