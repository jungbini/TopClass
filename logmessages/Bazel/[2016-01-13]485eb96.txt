  Make package names in the package_group.packages attribute refer to the repository where the package group is.  There is currently no way to refer to packages in other repositories and that doesn't seem to be useful, because visibility currently checks the repository name in the label and that can be changed in the main WORKSPACE file. If needed, it'd be pretty easy to implement, though.  As a drive-by fix, made the parsing of the package name call into the same logic implemented in the cmdline package because code duplication is bad, mmmkay?  Fixes #767.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=112032508
