  Switches AndroidRobolectricTest to using .aars to provide transitive resources to the test runner instead of ResourceContainers. Update AndroidLibraryAarProvider to contain transitive closure of .aars. Provides an ~4x speed improvement in test startup time.  NEW: Switched to ordered maps in CompositeLibraryAndroidManifestLocator to prevent manifest ordering flakiness bug. Switched to ImmutableSetMultimap in CompositeLibraryAndroidManifestLocator to prevent IllegalArgumentExceptions from duplicate package aliases and added test.  RELNOTES: android_resources is no longer allowed as a dep for android_robolectric_test.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=101972311
