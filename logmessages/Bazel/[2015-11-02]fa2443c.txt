  Fix AbstractQueueVisitor synchronization, comments, and field names  This fixes the following synchronization issue with AbstractQueueVisitor's jobsMustBeStoppedField: it was read in awaitTermination in a block synchronized on zeroRemainingTasks, but in markToStopAllJobsIfNeeded it was read and written in a block synchronized on the AQV instance. Now, it is always read or written in a block synchronized on zeroRemainingTasks, because it is used in the condition represented by that object.  This also thoroughly cleans up obsolete and irregular documentation in the class.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=106849236
