  Re-use the InMemoryNodeEntry#directDeps field for temporary direct deps.  The biggest savings here is that we were not eagerly discarding the InMemoryNodeEntry#directDeps field after an entry was marked dirty, even though we would never read its value again. But rather than just fix that, by getting rid of the field in BuildingState, we can potentially save memory with smaller BuildingState objects as well.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=126709632
