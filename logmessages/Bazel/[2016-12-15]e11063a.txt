  Move TestStrategy to lib.exec package.  This is part of refactoring test strategy to unify its implementation between Bazel and Blaze (Google's internal version of Bazel), which should fix several issues in Bazel.  It's also necessary to untangle lib.rules and lib.exec to enforce proper layering by separating compilation of these packages, and to provide a minimal Bazel binary. In particular, no core part of Bazel should depend on any of the rules, to facilitate moving them out of Bazel / reimplementing them in Skylark (except for some core rules like test_suite, alias, and genquery).  -- PiperOrigin-RevId: 142151901 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=142151901
