  fix accumulating logic around cached tests  there was an error in the accounting of how many tests were actually executed vs those that were cached. this was a result of not considering remotely cached tests when accumulating test results. fix the bug and add some unit tests to prove out functionality, as well as some javadoc clarifying functionality.
