  Release 0.3.0 (2016-06-10)  Baseline: a9301fa  Cherry picks: + ff30a73: Turn --legacy_external_runfiles back on by default + aeee3b8: Fix delete[] warning on fsevents.cc  Incompatible changes:  - The --cwarn command line option is not supported anymore.

Notably, we do not support '|=' because the semantics of skylark sets are sufficiently
