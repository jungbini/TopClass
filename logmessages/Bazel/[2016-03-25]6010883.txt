  Respect --noexperimental_check_output_files in FileSystemValueChecker. FileStateValues for output files can make their way into the Skyframe graph if a source file is symlink to an output file.  Also fix a bug where ExternalFilesHelper#isExternalFileSeen would always return true after returning true once in the past. This meant if an external file ever made its way into the Skyframe graph, we would always do a full graph scan at the beginning of each build (iow, we would always waste some CPU time doing nothing interesting).  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=118190190
