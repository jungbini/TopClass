  *** Reason for rollback ***  Broke ci.bazel.io  See #1231.  *** Original change description ***   Ship the environment fixed at configure time to the C++ compiler  Use a wrapper script on all platform to ship the environment to the C++ compiler. This should enable building with Homebrew special setup and will likely reduce the number of hard corner cases to solve.  Should unblock #1177.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=121468271
