  fix bug where cov info wasn't being printed for some builds  coverage information was being added only if the build wasn't cached locally, and only if it wasn't attached before. the former was undesirable as the coverage data is still there and interesting. the latter prevented information being displayed for sharded tests  note testing for exact coverage file names seems a bit flimsy, but if the code changes breaking our assumptions it should be simple enough to catch.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=85896250
