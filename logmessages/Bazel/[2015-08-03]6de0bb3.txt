  Fix docker_build file path when file is generated  If the file is generated, by a genrule for instance, then the stripping of the prefix was incorrect because the used path was containing 'bazel-out/...' prefix. This change moved the prefix stripping to the Skylark rule so we can use "short_path".  Also fix the test paths. Tested by bazel test //tools/build_defs/docker:build_test.  -- Change-Id: Ia3eb98268505002bade1f6b0dd916e1a9767a530 Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/1770 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=99710676
