  Bazel client; implement NormalizePath  This method can normalize paths with "." and ".." and multiple "/" characters.  E.g. normalize("../foo/./bar/../baz") = "foo/baz"  This method enables us implementing PathExists on Windows. If the path to check is too long, we need to prefix it with "\\?\" for the Windows API functions to work, but then the path must be fully normalized and in Windows format. We already have functions to convert a path to Windows format but that doesn't normalize; with this function we can finally convert paths like "/c/foo/../bar" to L"\\?\c:\foo" and check if it exists.
