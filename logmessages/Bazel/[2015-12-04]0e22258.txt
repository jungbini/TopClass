  docker_build: Properly handle / as data_path  The handling in _compute_data_path would incorrectly result in an empty strip_prefix being passed to _dest_path. The outcome was all files would end up at the top of directory, instead of nested according to the repository structure.  This change brings the behavior in line with the documentation, which states:  > This path can be absolute from the workspace root if starting with a > `/` or relative to the rule's directory.
