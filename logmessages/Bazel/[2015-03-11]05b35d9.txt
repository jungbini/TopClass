  Populate a new local repository with the files, not dir  Before, new_local_repository would create a symlink with the basename of the directory being linked to. For example, on my machine the JDK is in a directory named "jdk8", so the BUILD file had to prefix all of the files with "jdk8/". By symlinking the _contents_ of "path" instead of the basename of "path", the same BUILD file can be used no matter what the directory containing the JDK is called.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=88333728
