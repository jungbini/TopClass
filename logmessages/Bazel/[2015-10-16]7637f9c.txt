  Change the way sources are gathered for ASwB aspect.  This fixes android_resources being dropped on the ground because the source jar isn't included.  Previously, the java compilation args were used. This includes a bunch of implicit and generated source, like idl sources. The source jars include output from resource processing the rule itself, so it wasn't possible to start including that.  What we want are all explicit sources only. This CL does that.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=105624870
