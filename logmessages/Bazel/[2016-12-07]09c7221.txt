  Improved support for /MD and /MT in MSVC [#2120]  msvc_tools.py now prefers the last /MT / /MD option given; if none, /MD is preferred.  Additionally, the behaviour of the copt -g has been improved to enforce the debug version of the user-selected runtime, not necessarily /MTd.  Issue: #2120  Closes #2141.  -- Reviewed-on: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/2141 PiperOrigin-RevId: 141294930 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=141294930
