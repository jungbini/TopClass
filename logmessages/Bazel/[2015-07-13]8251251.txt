  Make two Skyframe nodes with the same events and values equal.  We do this by implementing equality for TaggedEvents (and all objects it transitively includes). Before this change, if a Skyframe node re-evaluated to the same value as in the previous build, but had (transitive) events, change pruning would not cut off the evaluation of its parents. This is not a big issue in practice because most nodes that would re-evaluate to the same value (like FileValues or GlobValues) never emit events, and others (like ActionExecutionValues) have secondary caches that mask this effect.  Also do a drive-by fix where we were using the hash code of a nested set instead of the shallow hash code (didn't have any bad effects in practice because we never hash these values).
