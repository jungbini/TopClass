  *** Reason for rollback ***  Breaks Bazel build on Ubuntu 15.10. Manually tested that rolling this back fixes the build.  *** Original change description ***  sandbox: Mount input files and directories actually read-only. Fixes #1364.  RELNOTES[INC]: Bazel's sandbox mounts input files read-only in this release. If your build suddenly fails due to tools not being able to write to files, then this is probably working as intended (you should never modify input files in your build), but please feel free to provide feedback.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=125439581
