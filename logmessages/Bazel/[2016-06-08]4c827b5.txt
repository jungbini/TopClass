  ExperimentalEventHandler: fix off-by-one error  Java's Arrays.copyOfRange expects as "to" argument the index of the first character not to be copied. As indices start with 0, the first index outside the array is, in fact, the length itself (and not one more than the length).  This off-by-one error so far never caused any problems, as Arrays.copyOfRange is guaranteed to accept arbitrary large "to" values and helpfully pads with 0-bytes. As 0-bytes are not shown on most terminals, the output still looked correct. However, that off-by-one error did mess up the output for users of the --experimental_show_artifacts flag.  -- Change-Id: I135ff720740db5c224a47668fc7513cbb7110f9f Reviewed-on: https://bazel-review.googlesource.com/#/c/3771 MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=124332337
