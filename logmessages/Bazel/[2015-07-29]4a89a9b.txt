  Check that most output artifacts are under a directory determined by the repository and package of the rule being analyzed. Currently this directory is PACKAGE for rules in the main repository and external/REPOSITORY_NAME/PACKAGE for rules in other repositories.  This is a plan to fix #293. Ideally, we would simply make it impossible to create artifacts not under that location, but in practice, we cannot do that because some rules do want to do this, mostly those that are already problematic due to shared actions. So the battle plan is to eliminate as many calls to AnalysisEnvironment.getDerivedArtifact() as I possibly can and audit the rest.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=99351151
