  Move the command line arguments for C++ preprocessor defines to a feature.  This required a few assorted changes:  - The LIPO compilation context is not merged anymore. Include paths for auxiliary files are apparently taken from the profile files, so it is not necessary. - The FDO build stamp is not special-cased anymore, it is treated as a preprocessor define like any other. - When compiling a .pcm file, use interfaceContext instead of the regular context when setting up the build variables. This is a bit more consistent and would be a good cause for a future bug.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=122725179
