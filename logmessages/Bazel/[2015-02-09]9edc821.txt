  Configurable attributes: allow multiple matches so long as one is a specialization of the other (e.g. {"foo=bar"} and {"foo=bar", "baz=bug"}. The most precise one wins.  RELNOTES: When two configurable attribute conditions match and one is a specialization of the other, the most precise match is chosen.  -- MOS_MIGRATED_REVID=85921611
