  Workaround for JRE bug freezing the PDE  Because of a JRE bug, code completion will occasionally freeze the PDE. Never seen this one before, however, it happened to me three times in a row while I was giving a lecture today and I had to kill the PDE and write all the code again. I can reproduce it back to beta 7. It is caused by JIT compiler, workaround is to disable it for this particular method.
