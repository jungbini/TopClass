X console - convert tabs to spaces o   line wrapping (but save info for resize? noo..) X fix to line numbers being off for KjcEngine exception highlights X changed error color slightly for console to fit status error X size() not being called in setup is gonna cause lots of headaches X   hack: put exception handler around setup and re-call if necessary X linefeeds were wrong in BApplet
