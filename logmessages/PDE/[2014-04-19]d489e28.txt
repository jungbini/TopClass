 Another 'fix': added a timeout before vm.resume()  I think we have a race condition: vm.resume() is called *before* the VM is actually ready to resume.  That is strange, since the debugger is attached, eventQueues are set up and ready...  Still, waiting for a bit ensures that the VM actually resumes.  This behavior was not present when Java 1.6 was still used.  Is this a bug in Java 1.7? Or is it simply that the VM in 1.6 started up quickly enough to hide the race condition?  I'll continue looking...
