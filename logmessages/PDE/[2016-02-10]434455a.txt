  Add two Raspberry Pi related fixes to JOGL  This is JOGL 2.3.2 with two fixes I wrote on top: https://github.com/sgothel/jogl/pull/96 https://github.com/sgothel/jogl/pull/97  Makes the output window centered when using the default closed-source driver on the Raspberry Pi, and adds support for using the new OpenGL driver with the files of the old one still in place. Tested on the Raspbian and OS X.
