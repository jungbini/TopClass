  Image transparency for PDF output  Before, drawing an image with transparency would result in black, opaque pixels in the PDF file. This change, figured out together with Jrg Lehni, fixes this. At its core, switching from drawImage(img, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int, null) to drawImage(img, int, int, null) seems to do the trick - so this might have been a bug in iText all along.
