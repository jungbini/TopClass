  fixes #2341 - inconsistent bounds checks  The core datastructure IntLost, FloatList, and StringList all have unsafe .get methods that do not perform bounds checking. This is in contrast to their .remove methods, which do perform bounds checking. Prior to this patch, the following would print 0:  IntList il = new IntList(); println(il.get(5));  But if we tried to *remove* that element, we would get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException:  il.remove(5);  This patch causes calls to .get to throw exceptions instead of returning 0 (or null in the case of StringList) for uninitialized values.
