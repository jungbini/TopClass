  #1681 Syntax highlighting with / bug low file :PdeKeywords.java function:markTokensImpl(...)  Explanation:  During the scanning of the line to check if the Token belongs to Processing Syntax ,When my current character is "/" , we check if the next character(if any) is "*" or "/" , and we do then an increment of the scanning index , so in this case , and if the next character in an alphabet we dont have a problem , but if it is " " (a space) , the loss of this character will make the  lastKeyword scan index incorrect , so we get this problem  of highlighting . To solve it, we check before incrementing the index, if the next character is " ", so we dont increment.  Result and Test: The example mouseX/ mouseY  highlight the two PDE keyword and the fix  http://processing.org/bugs/bugzilla/609.html //* println("1"); /*/ println("2"); //*/ still working .So i think this fix works
