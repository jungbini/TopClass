  Add a temporary workaround for the CHIP  Reported this to the CHIP team: Seeing some odd exception from deep within Java's awt classes ("Width (0) and height (0) must be non-zero"). This is triggered because the libX11 function XQueryBestCursor is returning a width and height of zero, which seems to be a bug. I am guessing that this will also pop up with other Java applications.  This makes things work on the CHIP w/ OS image 4.4 and latest packages. I also tested on OS X, but I am not familiar enough with the Tweak Mode to say for sure.
