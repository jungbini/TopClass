 Extract state from TokenMarker  TokenMarker now serves as a holder for keyword list and to provide marking logic. I extracted the rest into TokenMarkerState. Each tab now has its own state, preventing bugs by leaking TokenMarker state between tabs amd Editor instances.  There is no need to recompile any Modes, however TokenMarker should be redesigned in the next major version and Modes updated accordingly.  For more details read TokenMarkerState header.
