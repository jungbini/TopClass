Improvements for registering custom SQL exception translators in app c SPR-7680 Adding QueryTimeoutException to the DataAccessException hiera Minor polish in WebMvcConfigurationSupport Detect overridden boolean getters in ExtendedBeanInfo Polish ExtendedBeanInfoTests ...  commit 0a5392e37d268d4df9526216531a6655e52b9f38  Compensate for changes in JDK 7 Introspector  Prior to JDK 7, java.beans.Introspector registered indexed write methods irrespective of return type, for example either of the following methods were legal  void setFoo(int i, Foo foo) Object setFoo(int i, Foo foo)  This was considered a bug and disallowed starting with JDK 7, such that only the former signature is a candidate.  Supporting non-void returning setter methods is exactly what ExtendedBeanInfo was designed to do, and prior to this commit, the implementation of ExtendedBeanInfo assumed this (somewhat surprising) behavior from the underlying Introspector, and because it worked out of the box, took no extra steps to recognize and register these methods. For this reason, non-void returning indexed write methods were not registered under JDK 7+, causing test failures in ExtendedBeanInfoTests.  Now the implementation is careful to detect these methods without any assumption about Introspector behavior, such that they are registered in exactly the same fashion across JDK versions.
