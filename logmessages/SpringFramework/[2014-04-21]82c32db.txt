es() method in AnnotationReadingVisitorUtils resulted in mutation of the internal state of the ASM-based annotation metadata supplied to the method.  This commit fixes this issue by making a copy of the original AnnotationAttributes for the target annotation before merging attribute values from the meta-annotation hierarchy.  This commit also introduces a slight performance improvement by avoiding duplicate processing of the attributes of the target annotation.  Issue: SPR-11710 (cherry picked from commit e1720d89fcf65fca6b244df1696c1df67fc0c808)
