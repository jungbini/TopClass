ableSpringConfigured and SpringConfiguredConfiguration from the beans.factory.aspectj package to the context.annotation package where they belong.  This change is assumed to be very low impact as @EnableSpringConfigured was introduced in 3.1.0 and relocation is happening as quickly as possible in 3.1.2. @EnableSpringConfigured is assumed to be infrequently used at this point, and for those that are the migration path is straightforward. When upgrading from Spring 3.1.0 or 3.1.1, update import statements in any affected @Configuration classes to reflect the new packaging.  Backporter's note: this change causes Bundlor warnings in org.springframework.aspect as its manifest now "imports and exports the package org.springframework.context.annotation". To 'solve' this problem, `fail.on.warnings=false` has been added to build.properties. This means that future Bundlor-based warnings may go unnoticed.
