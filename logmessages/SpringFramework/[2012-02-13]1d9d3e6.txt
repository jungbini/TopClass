 AbstractResource#getFilename threw IllegalStateException unless overridden by a subclass. Following that change, this method now throws null instead, but ResourceTests#testAbstractResourceExceptions had not been updated to reflect, resulting in a false negative failure. This has now been fixed.  Issue: SPR-9043
