en setting up a stomp-endpoint with SockJS would not be taken into account:  <websocket:stomp-endpoint path="/foo"> <websocket:handshake-handler ref="customHandler"/> <websocket:sockjs/> </websocket:stomp-endpoint>  This commit fixes this by creating and registering a WebsocketTransportHandler (with this handshakeHandler) as a transportHandler override for the SockJSService.
