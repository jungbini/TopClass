eted SQL comments as separate statements, resulting in an exception when such a script is executed.  This commit addresses this issue by introducing a readScript(lineNumberReader, String) method that accepts a comment prefix. Comment lines are therefore no longer returned in the parsed script. Furthermore, the existing readScript(lineNumberReader) method now delegates to this new readScript() method, supplying "--" as the default comment prefix.
