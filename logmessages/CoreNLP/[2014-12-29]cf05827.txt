  AbstractSequenceClassifier: Make getKnownLCWords() available; change to using entity scoring method in IOBUtils which fixes error in old methods in dealing with adjacent entities of same class. GetPatternsFromDataMultiClass: insert into this class the countResults method from AbstractSequenceClassifier, since it is no longer there. But maybe this can also be changed to use IOUtils method. IOBUtils: Add new method for scoring entity TP,FP,FN coutns for any style of IOB annotation. StringUtils: Javadoc fixes. EntityClassificationSystem: Remove call to deprecated Index method. MetaMapAnnotator: Change to use countResults method in GetPatternsFromDataMultiClass, as above.
