Author: Sanjay Radia <sradia@yahoo-inc.com> Date:   Mon Dec 20 18:12:53 2010 -0800  Bugzilla 4219520 - fixed bug in viewfs to allow non-null authority. Hence URIs like viewfs://clusterXMountTableName/ work. Typical usage is where each cluster has its own mount table named after the cluster. That is authority in this URI will be set to the cluster name. This feature was always there. But there was a bug. - Note as part of this the AbstractFileSystem#getUri was fixed to allow optional authorites. (was needed for the main fix)  +++ b/YAHOO-CHANGES.txt + +     - fix bug in viewfs  to allow authority in viewfs uri as in viewfs://mountTableName/ +    This simplifies the usage sceanario where each cluster has its own mount table where the mount-table is +	named by say the cluster name. This allows the convenience of accessing a particular cluster +	via viewfs://clusterName/path +    Note this also allows one to access a private view via viewfs://fooViewMountTableName/ +    Note this feature was in there; this is merely a bug fix.   git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/yahoo-merge@1079156 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
