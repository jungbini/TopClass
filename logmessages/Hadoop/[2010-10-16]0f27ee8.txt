  HBASE-3114 Test up on hudson are leaking zookeeper ensemble  Trying this patch to see if it cures hudson of leakage  M src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/HBaseTestingUtility.java Add a passedZkCluster flag.  If we didn't start the zk cluster, don't shut it down on way out. M src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/TestHBaseTestingUtility.java Add a test that starts up three clusters in a vm all sharing single zk, each to its own chroot location.  Add to tables in each and very the add by doing same as the old TestMultiClusters used) M src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/replication/TestReplication.java Reenable shutdown of started clusters.  Hopefully this clears the leaking of zk ensembles up on hudson. M src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/zookeeper/ZooKeeperWatcher.java Testing, it looks like legitimately the callback for session connected can be invoked before construction of zookeeperwatcher finishes.  In particular the zookeeper data member can be null.  Hang around for a second of so before throwing an exception (Make the exception indicate the particular zkw by adding to the error message stack trace made at zkw construction -- helps with debugging this stuff)    git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/trunk@1023181 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
