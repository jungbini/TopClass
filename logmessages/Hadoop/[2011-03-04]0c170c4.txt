(omalley)  +++ b/YAHOO-CHANGES.txt +    HADOOP-6551, HDFS-986, MAPREDUCE-1503. Change API for tokens to throw +    exceptions instead of returning booleans. (omalley) + +    HADOOP-6572. Makes sure that SASL encryption and push to responder queue +    for the RPC response happens atomically. (Kan Zhang via ddas) +    HADOOP-6559. Makes the RPC client automatically re-login when the SASL +    connection setup fails. This is applicable to only keytab based logins. +    (ddas) +    HADOOP-6552. Puts renewTGT=true and useTicketCache=true for the keytab +    kerberos options. (ddas) +    HADOOP-6547, HDFS-949, MAPREDUCE-1470. Move Delegation token into Common +    so that we can use it for MapReduce also. It is a combined patch for +    common, hdfs and mr. (jitendra) +    HADOOP-6510,HDFS-935,MAPREDUCE-1464. Support for doAs to allow +    authenticated superuser to impersonate proxy users. It is a combined +    patch with compatible fixes in HDFS and MR. (jitendra) +    MAPREDUCE-1457. Fixes JobTracker to get the FileSystem object within +    getStagingAreaDir within a privileged block. Fixes Child.java to use the +    appropriate UGIs while getting the TaskUmbilicalProtocol proxy and while +    executing the task. Contributed by Jakob Homan. (ddas) +    Distributed Cache and Distcp. Also, provides a config +    mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers that the jobs can populate with a comma +    separated list of namenodes. The job client automatically fetches +    delegation tokens from those namenodes. +    HADOOP-4656, HDFS-685, MAPREDUCE-1083. Use the user-to-groups mapping +    service in the NameNode and JobTracker. Combined patch for these 3 jiras +    otherwise tests fail. (Jitendra Nath Pandey) +    HDFS-781. Namenode metrics PendingDeletionBlocks is not decremented. +    (suresh)   git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-0.20-security-patches@1077186 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
