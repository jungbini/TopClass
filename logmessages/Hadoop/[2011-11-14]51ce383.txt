  HDFS-2532. Add timeout to TestDfsOverAvroRpc  This test is timing out on trunk, causing tests below it to fail spuriously. This patch doesn't fix the issue -- just adds a JUnit timeout so that the failure is properly attributed to this test.   git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/trunk@1201963 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
