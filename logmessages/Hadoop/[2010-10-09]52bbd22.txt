  HBASE-3100 TestMergeTable failing in TRUNK  M src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/HBaseTestingUtility.java Some fixup to support stepped start up of mini cluster; allow starting dfs cluster, then later put an hbase mini cluster on top. (startMiniHBaseCluster, createRootDir): Added. D src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/AbstractMergeTestBase.java Removed messy subclass of HBaseClusterTestCase used building up some specific loaded regions.  Replaced with utility added to HBaseTestingUtility and by methods added to specific test. D src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/util/TestMergeMeta.java Deleted test that did nothing -- test merging of .META. -- but the superclass was making user regions, not multiple instances of .META. -- which we don't support anyways currently. M src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/util/TestMergeTable.java Rewritten to use HBaseTestingUtility.  Also added assertions that it actually did successful merge (Were none previous). M src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/catalog/CatalogTracker.java Added a new constructor.  Are the others redundant given I just added implementation of Abortable to HConnection interface (the implmementation of HConnection used implement it -- I've just moved it up into the Interface itself). M src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/util/HMerge.java Bit of minor cleanup refactoring. M src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/HConnectionManager.java The HConnection Interface now implements Abortable. M src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/HConnection.java Extend Abortable (The implementation was implementing Abortable anyways).   git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/trunk@1006219 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
