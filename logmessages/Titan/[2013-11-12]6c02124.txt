ntroduces Infinispan transaction support backed by the JBoss Transaction Manager, also known as Narayana and the core module of which is known as Arjuna.  The implementation uses javax.transaction where possible, which should theoretically ease a potential switch to an alternative JTA/JTS transaction provider (say, Atomikos).  This commit also changes the Infinispan store configuration from non-transactional to transactional for all tests.  I'll add the nontransactional configuration back in as a separate test execution in a future commit, so that each test for Infinispan is executed in both a transactional and nontransactional configuration.  I also removed the Infinispan LockKeyColumnValueStoreTest, since its semantics make no sense for a store that has builtin key-level locking that doesn't implement acquireLock.  It may make sense to re-add it with a nontransactional config.  This code is new, just barely tested, and should be assumed buggy.
