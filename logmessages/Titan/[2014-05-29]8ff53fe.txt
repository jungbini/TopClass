  Create HBase table before reading rowkey partition  This avoids a nonfatal but scary-looking exception when Titan is opened against a HBase cluster for the first time.  The HBaseStoreManager didn't check that Titan's table existed when reading the rowkey partitions for the table.  It would attempt to lookup rowkey bounds for a nonexistent table, leading to a TableNotFoundException.  It would proceed to create the table and this wouldn't occur on subsequent opens.  This should be fixed, since getLocalKeyPartition() now ensures that the table exists before trying to read its rowkey bounds.
