ree datatypes currently used in practice but not currently tested: enums, durations, and Object.class.  The new duration test coverage augments existing string-duration-parsing coverage in CommonConfigTest. WritableConfigurationTest is the base class from which the new HadoopConfigurationTest inherits, as do the existing KCVSConfigurationTest and CommonConfigTest classes.  This new test covers a bug in HadoopConfiguration that prevented it from setting or getting keys with datatype Object.class.  It fails right now.  AbstractConfiguration.getSubset requires that WriteConfiguration impls accept Object.class.
