ThriftStoreTest that run all the same test logic, except with SSL enabled in the store manager configuration.  Since cassandra.yaml needs certain config options set to enable SSL and point it at its keystore, this also required changes to the test harness.  The pom got new executions of the resources and surefire plugins; these filter SSLized cassandra.yaml into target/cassandra/conf/localhost-murmur-ssl/ and also copy (without resource filtering) a truststore and keystore to the same directory.  The keystore is used by cassandra.yaml and the truststore is used by the Titan configurations in AstyanaxSSLStoreTest and ThriftSSLStore_Test.  The Astyanax test passes, but the Thrift test fails due to multiple bugs in the CTConnectionFactory.makeRawConnection's SSL logic.  It should be calling setTrustStore instead of setKeyStore, and it needs to check whether the transport is already open before trying to open it.
