  Naive HBase deprecation fix  This removes references to now-deprecated HBase API methods.  However, it uses the simple approach to connection pooling recommended by the HConnectionManager API @ http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/HConnectionManager.html.  The problem with this is twofold:  * it's very slow -- even a tiny lock write takes on average 125 ms on my test machine, perhaps because of the heavyweight setup inside HConnection's implementation, which includes creating an executor  * my use of the HConnectionManager API may be leaking connections, because midway through the 0.94 test suite, the tests start dying with "Too many open files" when attempting to instantiate org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxnSocketNIO
