 backend with MetricsInstrumentedStoreManager early in startup, before wrapping with TTLKCVSManager.  TTLKCVSManager expects `instanceof CustomizeKCVSManager` on its encapsulated backend to be true unless it implements cell-level TTL; this is true of HBaseSM, but not of MetricsInstrumentedSM.  Doing instanceof <some manager-extension interface> in wrappers is generally problematic since we have so many manager/store wrapper classes.  The typecasts prevent the compiler from helping us catch this stuff.  However, this is (hopefully) the last commit before the next bugfix release, so I don't want to go overboard with hurried refactoring and break something else.  I made TTLKCVSManager implement CustomizeStoreKCVSManager and check that its wrapped backend is instanceof same when the openDatabase(name, ttl) method is invoked.
