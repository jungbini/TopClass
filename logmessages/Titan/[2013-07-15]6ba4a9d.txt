ad trouble teasing the harmless refactorings apart from the threadsafety problem and I probably cut too much of that commit out when trying to fix things.  Conflicts: doc titan-cassandra/pom.xml titan-cassandra/src/test/java/com/thinkaurelius/titan/diskstorage/cassandra/astyanax/InternalAstyanaxKeyColumnValueTest.java titan-persistit/pom.xml titan-test/src/main/java/com/thinkaurelius/titan/diskstorage/LockKeyColumnValueStoreTest.java  commit e1388ea5505a8cbc872b6c03c8ef3d0d58e8472c  Merging titan03's Astyanax config fix  commit 6ba4a9dca7b1bf4718a1d7fd69dbadf606adc8ce  Fix Astyanax config regression  c209160ecacc5498475d98b717c29f1ba7ac1439 forced Astyanax's NodeDiscoveryType and ConnectionPoolType settings to their respective Astyanax-level defaults (not the defaults at the top of AstyanaxStorageManager.java).  At issue was a builder method called twice without coordination between the two calls.  This commit also removes the superfluous "storage" prefix on config keys used in InternalAstyanaxKCVTest.
