re strings like "v_lock_" whereas the desired name is a single character like "w".  This was caused by Backend generating lock store names by calling store.getName() on the non-lock counterpart and appending the lock suffix.  Now HBase remembers the store name originally used to open the database and returns it from getName().  * Fixed bug where HBaseStoreManager would open a new store instance every time openDatabase(s) was called for some fixed string s when CF name shortening was enabled.  I think this was harmless from a correctenss point of view, but it needlessly wasted memory.
