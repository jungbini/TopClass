ult tx.close() behavior from commit to rollback.  This broke TitanGraphBaseTest and the classes that extend it.  This has been floating in my stash for a while as I swapped between branches.  It's enough to fix TitanGraphBaseTest and subclasses, but I am not convinced that it fixes all instances of the underlying problem (there could be tests that relied on the autocommit behavior that do not extend TGBT).
