Timeslices are mapped 1-to-1 with keys, and each individual MessagePuller run is only supposed to query one timeslice/key.  The regression manifested as dropping messages in the broken column slice belonging that belonged to the later of the two timeslices.  This commit also introduces a bunch of new logging output and a toString() implementation that I used when investigating the regression and which will probably be useful in future debugging.
