  Configuration option and namespace tweaks  * Created a new storage.lock namespace.  The following storage options have been stripped of their lock- prefixes and moved to the storage.lock namespace:  lock-backend lock-clean-expired lock-expiry-time lock-retries lock-wait-time  storage.local-lock-mediator-prefix has also been renamed storage.lock.local-mediator-group.  The definition of this option has also moved from ExpectedValueCheckingStore to GraphDatabaseConfiguration, where it now resides alongside the other LOCK_NS options.  * Added @PreInitializeConfigOptions to some classes  * Moved thrift-frame-size option from AbstractCassandraStoreManager to the Thrift manager, since both Astyanax and Embedded did nothing with this option aside from issue a warning.  This option now storage.cassandra.thrift.frame-size.  * Pulled index.[X].elasticsearch.max-result-set-size up a level to index.[X].max-result-set-size.  It's now defined in GraphDatabaseConfiguration.  ES is the only index that uses this option right now, but SOLR is very likely to use this option when it gets merged.
