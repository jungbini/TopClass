  Hacked an Astyanax-Recipes-based lock impl  This is a proof-of-concept, but it would need cleanup in titan-core's configuration of locking Backend.java, in the configuration of graphdb tests using Astyanax, and also would benefit from a common abstract base class providing functionality duplicated across AstyanaxRecipeLocker and ConsistentKeyLocker.  I moved towards the last point making LockState parameterized in the type of its LockStatus class, but there is still work to be done on that point and more on the other two.  The following three tests passed on my box with the new AstyanaxRecipeLocker in use (but the class is otherwise totally untested and should be presumed buggy):  * InternalAstyanaxGraphTest.java * InternalAstyanaxGraphConcurrentTest.java * InternalAstyanaxLockKeyColumnValueStoreTest.java
