amp.  titan-cassandra also recently got a new performance-regression test in the form of TitanEventualGraphTest#testCachePerformance().  This isn't part of @Category({ PerformanceTests.class }).  It's intended to be run as part of the regular test suite as a "sanity check" on the performance of the cache subsystem.  But titan-cassandra executes its tests in multiple threads, so while the test passed in isolation, it would sometimes randomly fail when other threads won the scheduler wars.  Now this test has its own @Category({ SerialTests.class }) and it runs in its own single-threaded surefire execution.
