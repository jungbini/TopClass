  Refactoring CF compression in embedded Cassandra  * Added support for disabling compression entirely in the embedded cassandra adapter per the config key introduced in #379  * Removed code that instantiates a compressor class from the embedded store manager, instead passing a string to Cassandra's CompressionParameters constructor.  The constructor handles reflective instantiation on our behalf.  This is an improvement because CompressionParameters contains logic to prepend "org.apache.cassandra.io.compress." to compressor strings that contain no dots, allowing shorthands like "SnappyCompressor". That's also our current default compressor string.  * Expanded debug log statements around compressor configuration in the embedded adapter
