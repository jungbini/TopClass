  Fix regression in LockKCVStoreTest  Logic to configure Rid and LocalLockMediator appropriately for faux-remote transactions was lost during test case refactoring.  I added an abstract method configureTransactions() to LockKCVSTest for the purpose of backend-specific transactions tweaks.  This is not an elegant solution and may be refactored out of existence later, but it gets the test case back to succeeding for now.  The only subclass of LockKCVStoreTest that actually works right now is for Cassandra, but this fix should also apply to HBase when we test it.
