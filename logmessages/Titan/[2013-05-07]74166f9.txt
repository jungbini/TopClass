  Locking logging tweaks and renewal fix  * Added new logging statements and reworded existing statements in ConsistentKeyLockTransaction and LocalLockMediator  * LocalLockMediator#unlock() now logs errors and returns false instead of generating assertion failures when called on an expired or nonexistent lock; call sites updated accordingly  * Replaced broken unit test in LockKeyColumnValueStoreTest named relockExtendsLocalExpiration with a new test method called repeatLockingDoesNotExtendExpiration (closes #264)
