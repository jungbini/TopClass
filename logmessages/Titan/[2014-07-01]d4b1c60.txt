 in TitanCassandraOutputFormatTest#testBulkEdgeDerivations that occurred on titan-hadoop-2 but not on titan-hadoop-1.  The link step was failing with an NPE when attempting to read the traversal direction from the config under H2 (but succeeding under H1).  I think this is due to the way Hadoop2Compiler handles job configuration; it sets custom config keys, including the traversal direction for link steps, on the reducer and mapper but not on the combiner.  This commit tries to pull the custom config keys up to the job level so that they're inherited by the combiner as well as the reducer and mapper.  At least, I think that's what's going on -- not 100% confident I've got the analysis correct, even though the fix seems to work.
