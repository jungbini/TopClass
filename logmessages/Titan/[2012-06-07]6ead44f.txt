  HBase: fix mutateMany timestamps  Replaced hard-coded timestamp value of 0L (and the TODO comments alongside them) with timestamps generated from System.currentTimeMillis().  Specifically, the timestamp for all deletions is equal to the value returned by System.currentTimeMillis() early in mutateMany, and the timestamp for all puts is that plus one. Just before returning, the method checks wthere System.currentTimeMillis() returns a value higher than the put timestamp; if not, it does Thread.sleep(1L) calls until this is so.
