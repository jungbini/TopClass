2.1 upgrade, so I wanted to make the smallest possible Guava version move (15->16) in this commit and stabilize titan-cassandra before trying to go to 18.  * C*2.1 uses JNA 4.  Upgrading C* also introduced dependency convergence failures for it.unimi.dsi:fastutil, clearspring.analytics:stream, and commons-math3 (but not commons-math).  Added dependencyManagement stanzas to use the newer version in each case.  * C*2.1 includes some CQL-friendly internals refactoring, e.g. the move from Column to Cell and the introduction of the sparse-vs-dense column idiom.  It also removed the mostly useless type parameters on Token and IPartitioner.  These changes required minor tweaks in the thrift/astyanax store and more extensive changes in the embedded store.  * C*2.1 uses logback.  logback ships with its own slf4j binding (which took precedence over the log4j-slf4j12 binding due to an accident of classpath ordering when I first upgraded the C* version).  Titan currently uses log4j for all of its tests, and if we eventually do move to logback, we should do it consistently throughout Titan; I don't want a mixture of logback.xml and log4j.properties files scattered throughout the submodules and living together indefinitely on a major branch.  I had to explicitly redeclare the slf4j-log4j12 artifact and the logback-classic artifact that contains logback's slf4j binding in titan-cassandra/pom.xml (in that order) to force the log4j12 binding to take precedence over the logback binding.  * C*2.1 has retired several config keys in our testing cassandra.yaml and refuses to start if they are present:  * memtable_flush_queue_size * in_memory_compaction_limit_in_mb * multithreaded_compaction * compaction_preheat_key_cache * preheat_kernel_page_cache  I deleted these keys.  I think we were using the default value in each case anyway.  * C*2.1 uses JAMM 0.3.0 (older C* versions used 0.2.5).  This required updating the -javaagent JVM parameter in our shell scripts.  * C*2.1 uses a library called airline for command-line argument parsing in nodetool (maybe other commands too?).  airline does not get pulled in automatically as a dependency of titan-cassandra.  I explicitly declared it as a dependency on titan-dist at version 0.6, the version that shipped in C*2.1.8's distro.  * Merged miscellaneous upstream changes to the C* shell scripts that we include in the Titan zipfiles.  Aside from accounting for nodetool's main class getting renamed, these changes seemed like mostly quoting fixes and environment sanity checks (like printing a helpful message when the script can't find the java binary).  I excluded the shell script changes related to logback, keeping the C* daemon started by titan.sh on log4j for now.  I updated the versions matrix to list Titan 1.0.0 as compatible with C* 1.2, 2.0, and 2.1.  Only the thrift/astyanax adapters are really compatible with 1.2 and 2.0 on the server-side; the embedded adapter is now closely wedded to 2.1 and cannot compile or run using older versions of the C* jar.  This is
