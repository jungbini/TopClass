anagement.  The target 0.98.x version was duplicated in several places prior to this commit.  Now the top-level pom property ${titan098.core.version} specifies the HBase 0.98 version (without the -hadoop2 suffix), which is appended in ${titan098.version}.  * Update to the latest HBase bugfix releases.  0.98 moved from .2 and .3 to .8, and 0.94 moved from .21 to .25.  0.96 does not appear to have new upstream bugfixes and stays at .2.
