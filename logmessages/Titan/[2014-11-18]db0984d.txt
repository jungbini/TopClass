  Fix misplaced semicolons in docs on TitanFactory  Besides fixing syntax errors in the BDB page's example TitanFactory invocation, I appended a semicolon after the `open()` call in the HBase and Cassandra example TitanFactory invocations to make them copy-paste friendlier.  All of these example code snippets declare Java as their markup language in the docs source and use Java-style explicit type declaration before the variable name, so I think this is appropriate.  I didn't touch the inmemory backend's TitanFactory snippet since the docs explicitly describe the snippet as a Gremlin fragment.  Fixes #801
