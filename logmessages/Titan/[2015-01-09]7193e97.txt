  Partial fix of titan-dist for 0.9  titan-dist now populates $REPO_ROOT/{bin,lib,ext,conf.log} with useful files again.  This had been disabled since the TP2-to-TP3 migration that changed the way the console worked.  This is only a partial fix. It still has some stale files (the "rexhome" directory is at best an anachronism now).  The zipfiles are also untested; the Hadoop-2-based zipfile probably needs to be excluded until upstream support is ready in TP3.
