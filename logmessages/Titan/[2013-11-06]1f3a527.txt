  Extending ISPN configuration options  InfinispanCacheStoreManager gains two configuration options:  * conffile (GraphDatabaseConfiguration.STORAGE_CONF_FILE_KEY) * cacheprefix (ICSM.INFINISPAN_CACHE_NAME_PREFIX_KEY)  The former defaults to null.  When it is non-null, it is interpreted as a path to an Infinispan XML config file and that file is used to instantiate the EmbeddedCacheManager instance.  When it is null, the default Infinispan global configuration takes effect.  The latter defaults to titan.  ICSM now uses cachenames in the form <prefix>:<dbname>.  For example, under the default configuration, the cache names are:  * titan:titan_ids * titan:edgestore * titan:edgestore_lock_ * titan:vertexindex * titan:vertexindex_lock_ * titan:edgeindex  The prefix is omitted from the value returned by InfinispanCacheStore#getName() and intended to be hidden from the graphdb layer above it.  Why add this feature?  Potential use cases for the configurable prefix include:  * running multiple distinct ISPN-backed databases concurrently, each with its own prefix  * resolving potential cache name conflicts with other ISPN clients (i.e. playing nice in a cotenant ISPN deployment)  * switching between
