actored the SimpleScanJob test in KeyColumnValueStoreTest. SimpleScanJob itself has been pulled up to a non-inner public class for reuse.  The test logic inside the scanTestWithSimpleJob method has been moved a static method on SimpleScanJob to allow the MapReduce-backed test to reuse it more easily.  Likewise, the loadValues method that prepares data fixtures required by the SimpleScanJob have been moved to static methods on KeyColumnValueStoreUtil to allow reuse by MapReduce.  * Made SimpleScanJob use the Configuration argument passed to its setup method for initialization, and added a crude hex serialization for its slicequery bounds.  Its modular arithmetic parameters involving vertex IDs are just serialized using the existing logic for numbers in the config impls.  Passing configuration around this way instead of doing it through construction is necessary for MapReduce where the submitting process is not in general the same as the executing process.  The alternative is to create a concrete subclass containing config parameters for every little cfg change, and this looked like a mess in the scanTestWithSimpleJob method when I tried it out.  * Separated job and graph configs in StandardScanner.  Formerly, one configuration was used for both purposes, but there's no reason to assume that the ScanJob uses GraphDatabaseConfiguration.ROOT_NS as its config root like Titan proper does.  Aside from the obviously related files, this change also touches one line in OLAPTest.  * Updated the titan-hadoop-parent/pom.xml to run the new MapReduce test at the appropriate surefire stage (when Cassandra's configs are in place)  * Added a basic ArrayList-extending implementation of EntryList that returns a wild guess for its heap usage.  The binary input formats still return Iterable<Entry>; this should probably change to a type that offers more of the capability in the underlying datastructures returned by HBase/Cassandra.  * Added some Hadoop1/2 compat code related to counters (the MR ScanMetrics implementation uses Counters).  This commit includes an unfinished (and completely untested) HadoopVertexScanMapper.  The configuration setup in that class still needs some work before it can be tested.
