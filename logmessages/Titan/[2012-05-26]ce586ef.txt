s dependencies on the CassandraThriftStorageManager type.  CassandraTransaction now has a reference of type StorageManager where it formerly needed a CassandraThriftStorageManager.  Locking column families are now lazily created in the backing Cassandra cluster (whereas they were formerly created eagerly during openDatabase()).  This commit also fixes a bug in the ID allocation code for Cassandra. Formerly, this code wasn't waiting after writing an ID block claim for the time period mandated by the protocol draft.  This could have caused contending claimants on an ID block to fail to detect their contention.  Now the code waits after writing an ID block when necessary.  This bug wasn't exposed under our current test cases and is fundamentally tricky to test because it's racy and distributed.  This commit also adds commented logic for a close() implementation on KCVStores that actually does something.  Cassandra doesn't use or really need a functioning close() method right now, so its commented, but I'm putting it in this commit for potential future reference.
