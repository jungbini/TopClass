  Refactor DocBook customizations for reuse  Extracted Titan CSS, HTML header tags, and main content wrapper tags into XSL templates for shared reuse in single-file and chunked-file HTML output.  Moved XSL sheets into subdirectory of doc.  Removed unnecessary "images/" prefix in relative image references in AsciiDoc source.  AsciiDoc's backend attribute "imagesdir" is the preferred way to control the directory prefix for image references.  Added a XSL stylesheet for chunked Titan documentation.  It compiles as XSLT and produces output, but the CSS style is broken; there's ~500 pixels of dead space between the static header and the start of content on every page.  More work needed before the chunked output is remotely usable.
