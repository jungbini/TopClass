  Hooked up new locking code to legacy interface  Added some ugly glue code between the newly simplified locking interface and the legacy graphdb ConsistentKeyLockStore/Transaction interface.  Still needs some cleanup, and expected value slices won't retry or gracefully handle errors.  In-memory and embedded Cassandra lockkeycolumnvaluestoretest classes passed, but there are probably still bugs at this stage.
