  Wrap QueryExecutor implementations with Metrics  This times and counts (invocations and exceptions counted separately) calls to the methods on implementations of the QueryExecutor interface, when the calling transaction has metrics enabled.  Any transaction-specific metrics prefix, if configured, is honored.  Time spent in iterators returned by methods on the QueryExecutor interface are *not* covered by these metrics.  This is part of #402.
