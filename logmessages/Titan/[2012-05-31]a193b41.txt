  Added Cassandra daemon embedding for testing  The tests formerly known as CassandraThriftKeyColumnValueTest, CassandraLockKeyColumnValueStoreTest, and CassandraGrapTest are now prefixed with "External".  This signifies that they start Cassandra in a process external to the JVM process for testing purposes.  Also added are the same classes with "Internal" in place of "External"; these use a newly-added thin wrapper around the org.apache.cassandra.thrift.CassandraDaemon class to start a Cassandra instance inside the JVM executing the tests.  pom.xml also excludes the newer Avro artifact required by HBase in favor of the older one required by Cassandra (this conflict caused fatal exceptions when trying to run an embedded Cassandra instance as described in the previous paragraph).  This might have broken HBase support.  We will almost certainly have to revisit this temporary exclusion later.
