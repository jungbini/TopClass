70c83f95eea3a6ebca8a2594a393a8ffa  Chunking AsciiDoc config option table by namespace  Instead of formatting one giant table with every standard Titan configuration option, the ConfigurationPrinter class now outputs one table per namespace.  The description of each namespace appears atop its table.  I also tried to standardize the column width on each of these tables, but I can't seem to get it working as documented.  I'm observing behavior exactly like that described in this mailing list discussion and associated bug:  https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/docbook-apps/201011/msg00139.html http://sourceforge.net/p/docbook/bugs/1151/  But that bug was fixed in mid 2010, and the stylesheets I'm using are from 2013...
