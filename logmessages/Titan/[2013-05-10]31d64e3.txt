  Fixing broken Map calls in Thrift mutateMany()  Calls to get() on this map received StaticBuffer, while calls to put() received ByteBuffer.  These types never return true for equals(), so get() always returned null.  This was a bug introduced during the ByteBuffer to StaticBuffer & friends conversion.  For additional discussion about the bug's failure mode, see the log for 6aa352dc29c3fb0fe0ca3c80be328de32f74b42f.
