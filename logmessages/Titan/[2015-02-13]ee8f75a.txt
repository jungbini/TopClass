or getSlice and acquireLock in TitanOperationCountingTest assertions broken by 278d8b988058183ed032b03959771864f6b37a0c.  That commit moved the code that increments counters for KCVS.* or StoreManager.mutateMany method calls such that BDB still passes, but stores that use the consistent key locker (Cassandra + HBase) fail. The counting now seems to happen after ExpectedValueCheckingStore/Manager method is invoked, but before the HBaseKCVS/Manager or Cassandra*KCVS/Manager method is invoked.  Hence acquireLock is apparently never invoked, and getSlice is subject to additional invocations as the ExpectedValue classes verify that the actual stored values match those required by lock requests.
