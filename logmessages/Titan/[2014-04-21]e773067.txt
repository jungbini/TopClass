 Increase timeout in #631  Attempting to punt this per discussion with @mbroecheler; not fixing the root problem, just increasing the timeout value involved in the test logic's race condition  A slightly more labor-intensive but more-reliable approach might be to make the test block up to a much longer timeout (order of magnitude longer than median runtime), but wakeup frequently to test whether its expected conditions have been met and bail out early if so.  The right way to do this that's a lot more work is to mock TimestampProvider and completely eliminate Thread.sleep calls in the test logic.
