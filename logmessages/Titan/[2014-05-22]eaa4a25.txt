  BerkeleyJEBlueprintsTest fixes  Modified cleanUp(), pre-suite, and post-suite methods to detect and warn on graph leaks in the underlying Blueprints test methods.  Also made cleanUp() and the post-suite method stop leaking unclosed store managers and made cleanUp() stop behaving like a no-op for the first test in the suite (important for repeated runs without a `mvn clean` in between).
