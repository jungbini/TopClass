  Fix bug in ExpectedValueCheckingTx  EVCT calls getSlice with bounds [col, nextBiggerBuffer(col)), where col is given by the caller.  This slice returns exact matches of col, if present in the backend, but it can also return longer columns for which col is a prefix.  This is a bug -- EVCT should be responsible for ignoring columns which aren't an exact match of col provided by the caller.  This manifested as a bug in ThriftGraphCacheTest#testGraphConfiguration which actually had nothing to do with db-cache.  The problem was that ECVT was considering both values for "cache.db-cache" and "cache.db-cache-time" when attempting to lock and check "cache.db-cache", causing a nonsensical PermanentLockingException.
