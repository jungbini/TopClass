  Fixes for chunked HTML DocBook output  * Remove dead space between sticky header and main content in chunked html output (singlepage html output did not have the issue to begin with); need to manually copy css to see effect of the fix since copying static assets isn't automated yet  * Modify titan.body template in titancommon.xsl to use <xsl:copy-of /> so that it can be more shared between the chunked and single-page XSL stylesheets  I've completely cut out the next/prev navs at the top and bottom of the chunked output.  Next step is probably to restore these links by embedding them in the the static and sticky page header at the top and just above the copyright footer at the bottom.  This will probably involve splitting the titan.body template in titancommon.xsl into a number of smaller component templates.
