way from the embeddedcassandra backend in favor of a standalone cassandra daemon, we can no longer rely on STORAGE_DIRECTORY being interpreted relative to the Titan configuration file.  This commit changes cassandra.in.sh to cd to $CASSANDRA_HOME (typically the directory containing titan's bin/ directory, or the grandparent of titan.sh) before starting Cassandra.  Fixes #825 (cherry picked from commit b2ad7e883d873b1e8425aedc31cefbf82aacb60c)
