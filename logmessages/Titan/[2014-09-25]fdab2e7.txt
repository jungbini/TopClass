  Revert ANTLR 3.x from 3.5 to 3.2  This should fix Cassandra (which compiled against 3.2 and depends on the org.antlr.runtime.Tokens.EOF_TOKEN field removed in 3.3) but could have broken Solr, which currently depends on ANTLR 3.5.  Can't tell since the Solr have preexisting config problems and don't pass right now.  If Solr can't use ANTLR 3.2, then we'll may have to use the shade plugin to ship multiple copies of ANTLR in order to allow Cassandra and Solr to coexist in the same VM.
