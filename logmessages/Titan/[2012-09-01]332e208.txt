ingTransactionHandle from milli- to nanoseconds using a factor of 1000 instead of 100000.  The other timing bug was older than my last commit. LockingTransactionHandle read nanosecond timestamps from the storage backend, but then proceeded to try to figure out whether those timestamps had expired by comparing them to milliseconds without conversion.  I've added test cases in LockKeyColumnValueStoreTest that should look for these cases.  LockingTransactionHandle is pretty fragile at this point.  It could probably benefit from some refactoring to reduce method size and per-method control structure nesting depth.  It might be wise to make it uniformly handle only nanosecond timestamps, too.
