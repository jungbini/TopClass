  Tweaks and fixes to Infinispan cache & manager  * Made close() and clearStorage() in InfinispanCacheStoreManager use Infinispan's internal set of cache names instead of an external map of Strings to InfinispanCacheStore instances.  openDatabase(String) still uses the external map, but this probably isn't technically necessary.  * Made replace() in the cache implementation obey its method contract when the actual value in the map does not match the expected value  * Made the manager's getName() method return the default Object#toString() -- this change probably isn't necessary for correctness, but it's more conservative than what it replaced
