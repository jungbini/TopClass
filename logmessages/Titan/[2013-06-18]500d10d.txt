  Refactor PersistitStoreManager towards BDB manager  Use FileStorageConfiguration and LocalStoreManager helper classes in PersistitStoreManager.  Also, implement the previously unimplemented setConfigurationProperty method of the Persistit store manager. Implementing this method fixes multiple test failures and lets "mvn clean test" pass in titan-persistit (on my box, at least).
