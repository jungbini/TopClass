w an exception or timed out would leave its StandardIDPool unable to progress for the rest of its lifetime.  After the first timeout/exception, StandardIDPool would never attempt another call to IDAuthority.getIDBlock.  This commit changes StandardIDPool to let it start a new call to IDAuthority.getIDBlock following an exception/timeout.  This also fixes the test just introduced in 2e637dd69812a4a7eb879e9f34ae03a1cfbfbaac.  There is no backoff logic introduced in this commit.  The assumption is that the IDAuthority implementation will contain a reasonable amount of backoff logic (e.g. BackendOperation.execute).
