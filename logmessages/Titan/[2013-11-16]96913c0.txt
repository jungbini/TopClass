  Make HBase shutdown more carefully in tests  When running memory and performance tests through Maven, I found that HBase would die after perf tests but fail to restart for mem tests.  This turned out to be ZK failing to bind its port.  The HBase test harness killed the HBase process with SIGTERM, which seems to prevent ZK from cleanly closing its listen socket, which then goes into TIME_WAIT and prevents the next ZK process from binding the port.  To fix this, I made the test harness first try to stop HBase using the clean shutdown script provided with the HBase distro, waiting up to 20 seconds for it to finish.  If it doesn't finish, the harness resorts to SIGKILL (not TERM).  This approach seems to resolve the issue -- now perf and mem tests both run successfully.
