  ConfigOption documentation and name changes  * Expanded and updated someConfigOption description strings in GraphDatabaseConfiguration  * Renamed merge-basic-metrics to metrics-merge-stores  * Renamed machine-id-appendix to unique-instance-id-suffix  * Modified ConfigurationPrinter to preload ConfigOptions in the classpath via reflections before iterating over the config object tree; extracted this logic into a helper class now that it is used in two places (ConfigurationPrinter and TitanFactory)  * Added PreInitializeConfigOptions to some classes in the storage/index backends  * Tweaked the AsciiDoc->DocBook stylesheet to break extremely long single-word default value strings instead of making the table run off the right side of the screen
