  Flip broken VertexIDAssignerTest partition bounds  Fixes #591  VertexIDAssignerTest uses a MockIDAuthority that takes its partition bounds as an integer array of length 2, then writes the ints to StaticBuffers in its getLocalIDPartition() method.  A precondition in this method checks that the lower buffer compares before the upper buffer.  VertexIDAssignerTest is a JUnit parameterized test, and one parameter set passed the int array { -10000, 10000 } to MockIDAuthority.  This was guaranteed to fail the precondition mentioned above, since the negative int has the MSB set and the positive int doesn't.  This showed up as an IllegalArgumentException in titan-test/target/test.log.  I think this bug was limited to MockIDAuthority and VertexIDAssignerTest.  I don't see how it could affect VertexIDAssigner or ConsistentKeyIDManager.  CKIM works in terms of opaque bytes.  VertexIDAssigner does work with ints, but it unsigned-shifts them down two bits before doing any comparisons, discarding the lower order bits and guaranteeing that the resulting int values are positive.
