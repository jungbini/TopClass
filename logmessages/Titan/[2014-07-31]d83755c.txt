 This commit also extends ModifiableHadoopConfiguration to support read/write views of TitanGraph configurations atop the titan.hadoop.input.conf and titan.hadoop.output.conf config key prefixes.  This commit also begins to modernize Faunus's tests.  Faunus tests generally use the legacy JUnit 3.x API, which prevents us from using some nice features of contemporary JUnit, like @BeforeClass or @Ignore.  TestCase-based execution also does wierd, possibly buggy things when executing individual methods (-Dtest=... or -Dit.test=...) on test classes that overload methods from a superclass.  The new annotation-driven test base class a copy of BaseTest called BaseTestNG.  This commit rewrites TitanOutputFormatTest and its subclasses Titan{Cassandra,HBase}OutputFormatTest to use it.  This commit also adds a @BeforeClass to TitanHBaseOutputFormatTest that starts a HBase daemon, so now the that test actually passes without having to manually start a HBase daemon for it to use first.
