  Add client-side ES version check (fixes #338)  At compile-time, Titan's ES version is written to titan-es.properties. The properties file gets included in the titan-es jar. ElasticSearchConstants loads the properties file at runtime using getResourceAsStream(...), just like TitanConstants. ElasticSearchConstants then converts the version into a public static final field on ES's Version class and loads that reflectively. Finally, ElasticSearchIndex compares this expected version against Version.CURRENT at runtime and logs a warning if they don't match.  Note that a version mismatch does *not* throw an exception.  It just logs a warning.  This is all hideous and byantine and awful.  I wish there was an easier way to check the ES version using only strings.  It's so easy to get the cluster's version using the REST HTTP API, but I don't see an equivalent way to do it with only the Java API, and I don't want to add a whole second client to the ES index implementation just to read a 6-byte version string.
