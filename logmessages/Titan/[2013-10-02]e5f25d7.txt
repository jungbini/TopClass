  Reverting maven-surefire from 2.16 to 2.15  2.16 included a regression that makes it impossible to run a single test method.  It's still possible to run all methods in a single class, just not a specific method.  http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SUREFIRE-1028  According to the 2.16 changelog in JIRA, the only substantial changes vs 2.15 were new parallel test execution options, none of which we actually use right now.  I do use single-method test execution though.  http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SUREFIRE/fixforversion/19331
