 Add new reserved words to the type system  The following words can no longer be used to define schema elements:  * vertex * element * edge * property * key  Fixes #634.  Partial fix for #730.  Closing #730 additionally requires reserving the word "label".  That reservation is not compatible with TP 3.0.0-incubating, which has some test code that still tries to use "label" as a type name.  We need apache/incubator-tinkerpop@fa994d3304a885bc52725e2890e53b2a1186c92b, either by going back to 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT or waiting for a new tag following 3.0.0-incubating.
