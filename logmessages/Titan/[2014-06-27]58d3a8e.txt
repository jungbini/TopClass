  Titan-Hadoop assembly-related fixes  * Added the old data/ directory from the Faunus zipfiles back into titan zipfiles as the example-data/ folder (to reduce the potential for confusion with the db/ directory used by the Cassandra and BDB configs we distribute)  * Removed several duplicates of Faunus data files  * Fixed titan-hadoop meta.properties generation.  This file stores the titan-hadoop version and the name of the default job jar.  It's parsed by titan-hadoop's Tokens class.  I broke it when pulling titan-hadoop-core out into a separate module yesterday, but now it's working again (I think) for both titan-hadoop-1 and -2, though I've only tested -2.  * Added a mapred-site.xml to the zipfile distribution.  It sets the MR execution framework to "local".  The presence of this file makes it easy to change to YARN or classic (I changed it to yarn when testing).  * Tweaked the log4j-gremlin.properties in the Titan zipfile to disable spurious config deprecation warnings caused by HADOOP-10178 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-10178)
