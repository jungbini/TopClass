  Finished refactoring of Titan tests for TP3M8 and associated debugging of TitanGraphTest and TitanOLAPTest. There were a number of quirks to work out. A noteworthy one is the fact that TinkerPop defaults vertex property cardinality to single when adding a property whereas Titan uses the schema to determine the cardinality. For compatibility, I added a config option so that the default behavior could be configured to match TinkerPop's.
