erver.sh instead of attempting (and failing) to call the rexster startup script.  This commit also tidies up the conf directory.  conf has gradually accreted files from various processes as we've added them to the distro over time.  Prior to this commit, it held configs for 4 distinct processes (Cassandra, ES, Gremlin-Server, Gremlin-Console) all mixed together.  I've split the Cassandra, ES, and Gremlin-Server files into subdirectories.  The Gremlin-Console files (e.g. Titan config files and remote.yaml) still remain direct children underneath conf, in the interests of minimizing keystroke tedium in the REPL. This change involved tweaking the *.in.sh files and ES startup script.  This commit also fixes logging configurations for the processes in the zip distro.  ES, Cassandra, and Gremlin-Server should each log to distinct files under the log subdirectory again.  This commit also removes (the last?) rexster anachronisms from the titan.sh script and file paths.
