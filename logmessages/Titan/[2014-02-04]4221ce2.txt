  Fix minor concurrency bug in IDPoolTest  Now that IDPoolTest threads actually run in parallel instead of serially (78b9a0af2e60db3ae841ccbfafe2393d0b56f030), they've run across a problem in MockIDAuthority.  Its getIDBlock method is instance-synchronized, but it needs to be concurrently accessed by multiple threads.  When delayAcquisitionMS is nonzero, this can result in unlucky threads waiting 2 or 3 times the delayAcquistionMS period and the enclosing test throwing an unexpected exception.  I tweaked MockIDAuthority's constructors to make the delayAcquisitionMS variable final, squinted at the getIDBlock implementation for a while looking for anything else thread-unsafe (found nothing), and then removed the synchronized modifier.
