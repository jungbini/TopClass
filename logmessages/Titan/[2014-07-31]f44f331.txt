nstructor that takes both a Configuration object and a String representing an internal key prefix. This internal key prefix is hidden from the user but applied whenever writing or reading config values.  The idea behind this extension is to eventually allow easy construction of a TitanGraph configuration atop a subset of Faunus configuration keys sharing a common prefix, such as titan.hadoop.input.conf or titan.hadoop.output.conf, without necessarily copying the underlying Configuration object.
