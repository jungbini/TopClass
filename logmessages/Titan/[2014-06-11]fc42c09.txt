ph.commit that caused transaction conflicts on storage backends with serializable isolation (but not on backends with weaker isolation guarantees).  It makes STG.commit only open a secondary transaction for schema mutations when the backend has weak isolation; when the backend provides strong isolation, it sticks to a single tx now.  This commit also changes the isolation level used in most of the BDB tests to serializable (from repeatable read, the default).  This commit still at least two known problems:  * TransactionalTitanGraphTestSuite.testCompetingThreads fails spectacularly with BDB configured for serializable isolation  * BerkeleyPartitionGraphTest.testVertexPartitioning nondeterministically fails.  These pseudorandom failures predate this commit; they are present on the ancestor commit also.  On my machine, 33 of 60 successive runs passed while the remaining 27 failed with a few
