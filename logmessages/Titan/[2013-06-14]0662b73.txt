  Setup MemoryMeter agent for Cassadra tests  The Cassandra tests currently spam this warning:  WARN org.apache.cassandra.db.Memtable - MemoryMeter uninitialized (jamm not specified as java agent); assuming liveRatio of 10.0. Usually this means cassandra-env.sh disabled jamm because you are using a buggy JRE; upgrade to the Sun JRE instead  This downloads @jbellis's jamm project before running tests and points the -javaagent JVM argument at the downloaded JAR file.  This optimistically assumes JVM support for JAMM without actually checking for it.  This means JAMM could break terribly when run using a really old OpenJDK version or any JVM that doesn't work properly with JAMM.
