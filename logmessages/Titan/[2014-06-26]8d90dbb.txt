The core module compiles against the same Hadoop 2.x version as the titan-hadoop-2 module, so in the event of an oversight failure on our part that leaks a bytecode-level Hadoop1/2 incompatibility into titan-hadoop-core, only the titan-hadoop-1 module will break.  This is technically inferior to the strategy used prior to this commit.  That approach had no titan-hadoop-core module.  The titan-hadoop-1 and titan-hadoop-2 modules shared each used the build helper plugin to add a common source directory to the build path, so that they had one directory containing hadoop1/2-specific sources and also had the common source directory.  The titan-hadoop-1 and -2 modules compiled every source file using their target Hadoop library version.  This is nice because it precludes classfile linkage errors at runtime, but the downside is that neither Eclipse m2e nor IDEA are capable of comprehending this Maven configuration, rendering them little more than red-colored text editors on the modules in question.  Contrast this with the approach in this commit, where titan-hadoop-core is compiled against a Hadoop 2 jar, and it's on us to keep out IncompatibleClassChange-inducing ABI incompatibilites. This raises the possibility of runtime classfile linkage errors, but the upshot is that both Eclipse and IDEA can understand it.  This commit makes a few other changes:  * deleted BlueprintsGraphOutputMapReduce and replaced calls to its static methods with equivalent static calls on TitanGraphOutputMapReduce  * deleted BlueprintsGraphOutputMapReduceTest; there is some test logic in here that would be nice to port to Titan, but replacing TinkerGraph with Titan without breaking/rewriting the test seemed nontrivial  * Shortened some config keys: titan.hadoop.graph.input.titan  -> titan.hadoop.input titan.hadoop.graph.output.titan -> titan.hadoop.output  The config changes are barely tested.  The config keys are probably going to get tweaked again in the future to fit them into a ConfigNamespace and/or to avoid potential collisions with other keys in the titan.hadoop.graph.input prefix (e.g. "location").
