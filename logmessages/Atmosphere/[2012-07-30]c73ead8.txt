  Reworked Interceptor interface and interceptor logic to use a tripartite model. Each interceptor is called with a prePayload call to serve any necessary prefixed content, then a transformPayload call, which is a bit of a misnomer, since it usually does nothing more than pass on the data unchanged. Finally, a call to postPayload is made to suffix any necessary content. The order in which loaded interceptors are called is reversed for postPayload.
