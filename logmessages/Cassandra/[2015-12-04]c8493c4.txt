  Explicitly handle SSL handshake errors during connect()  patch by Stefan Podkowinski; reviewed by aweisberg for CASSANDRA-10816  Any IOException before this patch has just been logged to debug and retried in case of outgoing connections. Any issues with SSL certificates would only be reported in case the log level is set to debug, which won't be the case on most clusters. The existing retry loop for the outgoing connect() call would also not make much sense in case of SSL handshake errors and cause unnecessary load while constantly running into the same handshake error again.
