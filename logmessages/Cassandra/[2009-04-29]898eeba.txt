  start SelectorManager after all the selector registration is done, to workaround a bug in some linux environments.  (Debian etch under vmware player or under EC2 seem to exhibit this problem consistently.)  the bug symptom is, the selector register hangs indefinitely even though the select() call is only for 100ms (after which it should stop blocking and let the register through). patch by jbellis; reviewed by Eric Evans for #97  git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/cassandra/trunk@769631 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
