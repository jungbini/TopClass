  CASSANDRA-296 fix grammar breakage  Changeset ada820 was an attempt to make hostname parsing less stupid, (i.e. don't allow underscores; do allow hyphens; allow IP addresses). It didn't entirely fix the problems it set out to and it broke parsing of anything that used the "Identifier" lexer, (for example the thrift {get,set} ... commands).  This changeset partially reverts ada820 until a proper fix to hostname parsing can be found.  git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/cassandra/trunk@802908 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
