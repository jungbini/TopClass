  Ninja: update cqlsh completion tests for CASSANDRA-8844  In CASSANDRA-8844, a new 'cdc' table option was added.  The python driver added this as a recognized option, which caused it to show up in cqlsh autocomplete suggestions.  However, the cqlsh tests were not updated to match this.  This should fix the following failing tests: - test_complete_in_create_table - test_complete_in_create_columnfamily
