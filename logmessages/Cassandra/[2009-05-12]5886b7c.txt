  fix race condition in compaction -- it was possible for a read thread to "snapshot" ssTables_, then have the compactor thread delete those (after merging them into a new file) before the read thread checked them.  Since the read thread's "snapshot" doesn't include the new merged sstable, it incorrectly tells the caller that the key does not exist. patch by jbellis; reviewed by Eric Evans for CASSANDRA-161  git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/cassandra/trunk@774023 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
