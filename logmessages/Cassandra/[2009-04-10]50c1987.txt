  fix getCompactionBuckets -- something is broken in NonBlockingHashMap when removing and re-adding the same collection mid-iteration; it ends up with multiple references to that collection.  going back to ConcurrentHashMap fixes the problem.  (any additional overhead from CHM is negligible here.)  patch by jbellis; reviewed by Eric Evans for #57  git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/cassandra/trunk@764004 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
