  Sends the proper amount of cells to old nodes on DISTINCT  patch by slebresne; reviewed by blerer for CASSANDRA-10762  On a DISTINCT query, 3.0 nodes were sending the 1 row back, but pre-3.0 nodes actually expect only the 1st cell and limits get thrown off if they get more. This could actually be a problem for thrift queries (on CQL tables only) when the limit ended up in the middle of a row. The patch fixes this by enforcing the cell limit while serializing the response to old nodes.
