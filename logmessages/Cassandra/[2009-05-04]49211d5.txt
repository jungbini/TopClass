  change Message body to byte[].  this reveals where there are problems: everything that is using any of the send messages already needs to be doing that or they're broken.  the good ones I just unwrap; the broken ones I fixed except for MoveMessage which doesn't even have a byte[] serializer yet, so I left that one broken.  writeResponseResolver is the specific case that caused the bug report. patch by jbellis; reviewed by nk11 for CASSANDRA-120  git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/cassandra/trunk@771402 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
