  separate assignment of current keyspace from login()  This changeset is based on Todd Blose's patch, with some changes:  * Fixed some style nits, (braches on newlines, etc) * Reinstated debug log statement in CassandraServer.login() * Reinstated css_.debug test when printing stacktrace in the CLI * Removed unused _login() function from system tests * Updated contrib/utils/service/CassandraServiceTest for login() change * Disabled system_add_keyspace() when authentication is enabled (login() requires a keyspace). * Reset access level (force a new login) when keyspace is changed using set_keyspace().
