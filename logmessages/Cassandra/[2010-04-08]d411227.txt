  RingCache fixups in the wake of CASSANDRA-44  * invoke DatabaseDescriptor.loadSchemas from RingCache ctor (needed now to populate DD's table list). * improved error handling in DD.getReplicaPlacementStrategyClass so that any future failures to call loadSchemas are easier to spot. * updated TestRingCache. This was never runnable as a unit test, (it requires a running instance), and doing static initialization is problematic now that RingCache's ctor throws IOExceptions.
