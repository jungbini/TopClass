  fix the bootstrap interaction with gossip; there were two main problems: 1) token and bootstrap state are not guaranteed to be gossiped together; since we only updated TMD.bootstrapNodes on an update of the token, this means we could actually miss the bootstrap notice 2) deletions of state are not actually supported by Gossiper; there is no concept of that at the protocol level. so if we delete state locally it will never get gossiped. Instead, we have a MODE that is either MOVING or NORMAL, corresponding to bootstrap & normal operation.  patch by jbellis; reviewed by goffinet for CASSANDRA-483  git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/cassandra/trunk@830212 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
