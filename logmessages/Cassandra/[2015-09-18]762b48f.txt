  Properly extract whether a legacy slice queries static columns  Pre-3.0 nodes were using the slices to query or not static columns. 3.0 handles this though the ColumnFilter (by explicitly asking for static columns or not) and has no real way to do so through its slices.  The backward compatibility code was not handling this correctly: it was generating the 3.0 slices from the pre-3.0 one somewhat blindly, and then checking if said slices were including Clustering.STATIC. This work most of the time because most query selecting static simply started at Slice.Bound.BOTTOM which ended up selecting Clustering.STATIC, but wasn't fully correct.  The patch makes sure we detect if static are selected when deserializing the old slices.  The patch also fix a case of incorrect thrift limit in pagedRangeCommand  patch by slebresne & bdeggleston; reviewed by slebresne & bdeggleston for CASSANDRA-10267
