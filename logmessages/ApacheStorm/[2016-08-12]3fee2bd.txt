  STORM-2016 Topology submission improvement: support adding local jars and maven artifacts on submission  *NOTE* This contains a bugfix at creating symbolic link and forward reference in storm.thrift (from STORM-1994)  * bin/storm now supports "--jars" and "--artifacts" options ** it's only effective with "storm jar" and "storm sql" * introduce new module: storm-submit-tools to help resolving dependencies with handling transitive dependencies * StormSubmitter will upload dependencies to BlobStore when submitting topology ** StormSubmitter will remove jars blobs when topology submission fails *** remove jar blobs when only one of AlreadyAliveException, InvalidTopologyException, AuthorizationException occurs * Supervisor will download dependencies from BlobStore when such topology is assigned * Supervisor will launch workers with adding downloaded dependencies to worker classpath * Nimbus will remove jars from BlobStore when topology is killed ** don't remove artifacts from blobstore since it's shared across topologies * add options to document (Command-line-client.md) and also storm.py ** it will be printed out when 'help jar' and 'help sql' is called
