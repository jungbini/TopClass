  STORM-1730 LocalCluster#shutdown() does not terminate all storm threads/thread pools.  The thread pool that is remaining is in a static context of the DisruptorQueue.  To avoid major changes to how this queues lifecycle is managed the fix is to create a thread pool factory which creates daemon threads.  The threads are now also named with the 'disruptor-flush' prefix to be consistent with the TimerTask.
