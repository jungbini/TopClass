  configurable supervisor log filename  For the storm-on-mesos project there are multiple Storm Supervisors on every worker host.  Each of these Supervisors is dedicated to a particular topology.  A challenge with this design is that the shared supervisor log file contains logs from every single topology that has run on a particular host.  We instead want the option to have separate supervisor log files for each topology, so that topology owners can more easily debug their own problems.  This change allows having configurable log files for every launch of the Supervisor, since we will be able to embed the topology ID into the supervisor log filename.  Notably, storm-0.10 already includes a similar change for the worker log filenames (came in with Yahoo!'s multi-tenant changes).
