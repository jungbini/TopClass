  Added schemas and validators to Config  Details: * For every Config there is a schema of type Object named with the _SCHEMA suffix (e.g., TOPOLOGY_WORKERS_SCHEMA) * For simple Classes (String, Number, Boolean), just the Class is sufficient for the schema's value * For other Classes, instances of the FieldValidator interface are used. * FieldValidator declares a method to validate the field and a method to return a plain-language description of the criteria for the user.  Status: Compiles, but not tested.  Nothing makes use of the schemas yet.
