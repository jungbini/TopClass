  Rankings: make updateWith() thread-safe  This fixes a ConcurrentModificationException that could be triggered when using log4j to log Rankings#toString() from within a bolt's execute() method.  Apparently a separate thread is used by log4j to perform the logging, whose execution path could interweave with the bolt's own thread.  Even though this is not necessarily a deficiency of the Rankings class (which does not claim to be thread-safe), we still decided to make Rankings#updateWith() thread-safe so that users do not run into errors when using log4j & Co. for logging purposes.  In other words, we decided to add this fix for the convenience of our users.
