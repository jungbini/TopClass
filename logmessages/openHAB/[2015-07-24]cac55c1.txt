  Double quotes should not be part of the state/command string. This fix removes them.  Item <item> received command "Armed Away" Item <item> received update "Armed-Away" Item <item> changed from Disarmed to "Armed-Away"  Without removing the double quotes, the rule will never trigger because Armed-Away != "Armed-Away".  Fixes issue #2552: Rule trigger 'changed from to' does not work for string items
