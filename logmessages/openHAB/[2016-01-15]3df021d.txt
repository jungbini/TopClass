 Some further cleanup: - removed further bundles, which are no addons - fixed the TP definition reference - remove maven site plugin as we never ever used it - fixed the xml bundles - removed the jdeb definition from bundles/pom.xml (note: as the single addons still reference it in there pom.xml, there is a long list of warnings at the moment)  Signed-off-by: Kai Kreuzer <kai@openhab.org>
