 MiOS Binding - Correct build errors from PR #3946  In PR #3946, I went ahead without validation.  Kai later provided the necessary steps to validate the config, so I fixed the errors that resulted.  For reference, when making this type of change in `openhab` repo, you need to also do a `mvn clean install` from the `openhab-distro` repo.
