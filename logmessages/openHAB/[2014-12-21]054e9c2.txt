Reimplmented hashCode and equals using eclipse's Source->Generate hashcode() and equals()... merged and resolved conflicts Dimmers are sometimes returning 0xfe instead of 0xff when on, treat these cases as on. Also, only send percentage level when dimmer is not on or off. dimmermax wasn't working with loaddimmer Implmented ablity to set a max level for dimmers, format is insteonplm="XX.YY.ZZ:F00.00.11#dimmer,dimmermax=70"} updated Bundle-Version: to 1.7.0.qualifier Revert "Ingnore duplicate messages from a device within a 2 second timefame. This is currently only" Ingnore duplicate messages from a device within a 2 second timefame. This is currently only implemented for Light message handlers. Future work is to make the timeframe configurable both globally and on a per item basis. The default timeframe will be further adjusted after more metrics are collected. 2 seconds currently is ignoring approx 94% of duplicate messages. InsteonPLM binding: implemented "group" parameter for command handlers that allow to send on/off commands to groups rather than individual devices. Linking keypad buttons to modem group n and then specifying group=n in the item binding config permits openhab to change the state of the buttons. insteonplm: fixed warning in ModemDBBuilder class insteonplm binding: prettier logging of modem database ...  commit 5073fe5762dbaf6303de7cb99081ea1e6a2a61a1  Merge pull request #1880 from berndpfrommer/insteonplm  InsteonPLM: better support for Keypad Buttons and various fixes:  commit 054e9c2096e715fb17d8d0b0f7b342f057785fce  insteonplm: fixed compiler errors due to usage of Java7 syntax in MessageHandler.java
