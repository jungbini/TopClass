 InsteonPLM:  - use ConcurrentHashMap to avoid synchronized() sections in InsteonPLMActiveBinding class  - fixes for iMeter calculations  - the concept of "related" devices is introduced. When a device changes its state, all related devices are polled as well. This is useful for 3-way switch configurations  - a DeviceFeature can now act as a group of other DeviceFeatures. These feature groups allow for consolidated polling when one message can query multiple features' values at the same time.  - added protecting synchronized statements around m_devices in InsteonPLM binding  - added explicit expiration time to request queue entries to control message delay better
