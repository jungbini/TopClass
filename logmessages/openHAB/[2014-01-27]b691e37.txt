 - removed unneccessary PollingDelayFilter - improved implementation of the BroadcasterCache - Bugfix: during a reconnect, the Broadcaster is emtpy and no messages where broadcasted and therefore these messages could not be cached and were lost. Now all status updates are broadcasted. The Atmosphere framework decides wether the update is directly broadcasted (when there are clients available) or it is cached (when there are no clients available) or nothing happens (when the broadcaster got destroyed because it has been idle for at least 5 minutes)
