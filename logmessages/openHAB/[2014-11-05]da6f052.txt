 bump java environment to fix annotation compliance  Well, there is a @Override annotation on one of the methods, but it doesnt have a superclassit is annotating a method that is being implemented (from an interface), not a method that is inherited (from a superclass).  The @Override annotation is a Java 1.5 feature, and the error message I was getting was coming (correctly) from a 1.5 compiler. However in Java 1.6 the @Override annotation can also be applied to methods that are implemented from an interface.
