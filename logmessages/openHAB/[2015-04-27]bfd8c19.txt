 Merge pull request #2371 from Snickermicker/pr_2330  Bug fix for KNX binding, Time update from ntp in March #2330  commit bfd8c1976d48987cb948cb7ad203cbccfd7af8cb  Update the HUE binding to work with non continuous device numbers on the bridge (speed up the initial loading)  Due the new option to delete bulb on the Hue bridge the old assumption of continuous device numbers is no longer true. The for loop in HueBinding.java crashed with a NPE if it hits a deleted bulb.  The second fix in the update is a speed up of updates/initial reads by removing multiple call to the settings on the bridge. The code now fetches the settings once per refresh from the bridge and hands the settings over the the bulb construction.
