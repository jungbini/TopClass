 Added Nightmode support for the newer RGBW bulbs.  Milight Binding: Fixed brightness setting for white milight builbs  The white milight bulbs have 10 levels of brightness + Off so there are 11 possible settings between 0 and 100%. It was at 10 settings and so a disparity between desired brightness setting vs. actual brightness would accrue during use. Also, to engage the desired bulb, an on signal needed to be sent before the brightness setting. This was all fixed in this update.

Rolls back Jan 21, 2015 change that broke HSB brightness. The 3rd part of HSB color is brightness and it's especially important for the Milight binding because these bulbs store their color brightness separately from their whitemode brightness. So color does need to have its own way to set and remember its brightness.  switched logger info to debug level.
