  openhab-designer: set default swt.browser to mozilla  because using webkit ends with a segfault in libsoup.  This seems to be a common problem with this eclipse version and should be fixed in newer versions. But according to the replies on the according bug report: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=404776 this should be a workaround that works for many people.
