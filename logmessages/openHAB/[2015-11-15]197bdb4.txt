  Base64 support and error comparing classes  Ive added support for Base64 communication because some bytes from serial devices are causing problems in the rest api: (see https://community.openhab.org/t/error-in-rest-service-when-serial-port-s ends-stx-ack-eot-bytes/3932/2)  I also fixed an error when no regex is used. (entry.getValue().type.isInstance(SwitchItem.class) was never true)
