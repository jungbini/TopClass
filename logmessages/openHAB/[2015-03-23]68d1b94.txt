  MiOS - Improve diagnostics for failed HTTP requests to MiOS Unit. When a MiOS Unit is called, as a result of a Command, these calls can fail.  When they do, we need better diagnostics as to when/if it's failing, so we can work out why.  Sometimes, this is just because the configurable Transformations have been incorrectly setup, but we'd fail silently which made it hard to debug in the field.
