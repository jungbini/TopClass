  [caldav] fix #4820 recurring events not scheduled (#4855)  * Attempt to fix #4820 recurring events not scheduled  Added a lot of trace and debug lines to be able to understand what was going on  revert .classpath modifications cosmetics + small perf improvement remove lambda expression (jenkins alergic)  * remove unrelated trace logs relative to categories  to prevent merge conflicts. They will be added in "filtercategoryany" PR.  * remove commented code  but kept explanation as of why I removed the code "oldEventIds.remove(filename);" (the javadocs tells that remove only removes first occurence in a list)
