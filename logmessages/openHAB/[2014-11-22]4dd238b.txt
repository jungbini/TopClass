 Merge branch 'master' into zwave-initialisation  * master: (53 commits) Remove sending of 'inclusion end' message within inclusion handler. This is now handled within the client, from the event handler. This allows the client to handle the error better, and also handle other reasons for stopping inclusion. Fix error queuing packet to stop inclusion/exclusion Improved handling of include/exclude requests Updated handling of inclusion timer.
