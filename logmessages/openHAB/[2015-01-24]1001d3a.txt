 Merge branch 'zwave-initialisation' into zwave-initialisation_state  * zwave-initialisation: Bugfix for issue #1351 Configurable command interval Removed annoying bin folders including .project files issue #2027 - added modified callback for dynamic changes to the binding configuration Fix RRD4J error at midnight changed the archetype default binding project according to #2720 updated the copyright header with the year 2015 added immediate="true" flag to binding.xml, otherwise the binding does  not get started automatically removed unnecessary imports removed the Activator. The bundleContext is available from the call to  the activate method. The static Activator access is discouraged, since  it is only valid when the bundle is ACTIVE, however, any code could  access the static variable at any point in time  commit 86da6aa01b14239bbd5f672be83af3cacb3cf55b  Merge branch 'zwave-database_updates' into zwave-initialisation  * zwave-database_updates: Add TKB TZ06 Update codes for Fibaro universal sensor Bugfix for issue #1351 Configurable command interval Removed annoying bin folders including .project files issue #2027 - added modified callback for dynamic changes to the binding configuration Fix RRD4J error at midnight changed the archetype default binding project according to #2720 updated the copyright header with the year 2015 added immediate="true" flag to binding.xml, otherwise the binding does  not get started automatically removed unnecessary imports removed the Activator.

I found that sometimes it's possible for the response to a transaction to come in before the ack from the controller. This causes the binding to send the next request but because the controller hasn't acked its request, we get a NAK. We need to therefore wait for both the response to the SendData request, and the Application Message.
