 Merge pull request #2127 from innoq/classicui-infiniteXHR  Fixes dimmer/rolershutter infinite request bug  commit 386d44737b3633b3d123e388d488ba77f06b57cd  Fixes dimmer/rolershutter infinite request bug  On long presses, the dimmer widget does XHRs forever, because the touchend-Handler wasn't attached correctly. The attribute was `touchend="..."` which has to be `ontouchend="..."`.  Additional goodies: * Add quotes to all HTML arguments * Introduced document.OH namespace to encapsulate openHAB stuff and don't pollute the global namespace * Remove evil eval in setTimeout * Removed unused parameters * Grouped dimmer and rollershutter in own state holding objects * On page change, reset all timers/intervals to be sure not to fire. (Special use case for multitouch)
