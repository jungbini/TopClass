 from apache/master df324de [joelz] Fixing cross origin bug for rest calls that allow a malicious user to issue requests from a site other than the zeppelin server. Adding unit tests and a dependency to mockito to the server project (please comment if that is ok or if there is another preferred mocking framework). Also upgrading the servelet version from 2.5 to 3.0 as this also fixes a security vulnerability with respect to httonly cookies. cecbab8 [joelz] Fixing cross origin bug for rest calls that allow a malicious user to issue requests from a site other than the zeppelin server.
