  Fixes a bug where dead property assignment elimination would remove writes that were used in getters/setters.  There is now a pre-order collector to find any property names that are assigned to a getter/setter. The later traversal will then treat any reference to properties with this name as if they were a call (assumes all properties are read). ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=123247955
