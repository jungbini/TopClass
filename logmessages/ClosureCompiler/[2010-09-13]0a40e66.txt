  fix a weird integration issue. some processes run the provide/require processor after scope creation.  That means that TypedScopeCreator can't assign types to the new namespaces.  Normal closure compiler is moving towards a model where TypedScopeCreator declares namespaces in the global scope. It's not clear how we should resolve this inconsistency, but for now this shim will make things better.
