  Collapse typedefs specially This is kind of a hack to support a use-case that currently works by accident.  goog.provide('foo.Bar.Baz'); /** @typedef */ foo.Bar.Baz; foo.Bar = function() {};  which gets transformed to  foo.Bar = {}; foo.Bar.Baz = {}; foo.Bar.Baz; foo.Bar = function() {};  which "works", but is all sorts of weird type-system-wise.  I'm not sure if we should fix this as a one-off, or try something more general (like treating all "stubs" as declarations).
