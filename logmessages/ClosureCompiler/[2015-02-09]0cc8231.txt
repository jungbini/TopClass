  Add a @suppress {checkTypes} to the global "module" function.  This collides with the various global "module" vars from jQuery plugins.  In practice, they should not collide, but the build system considers it an error that two externs.js files reference module, one via var, and this one via function. Unfortunately, the suppression has to be made here since this one is the function, and the error is "function 'module' masks variable (IE bug)" ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=85913215
