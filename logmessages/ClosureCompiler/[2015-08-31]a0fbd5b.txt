  Scope related fixes and optimizations  Removed the confusing inFunction() method in NodeTraversal and added inGlobalHoistScope().  Given NodeTraversal t, prefer t.inGlobalHoistScope() over t.getClosestHoistScope().isGlobal() because the former never scans any scopes.  Prefer t.getEnclosingFunction() over NodeUtil.getEnclosingFunction(n) because the former scans less nodes in general.  Fixed ScopedAlias to not report extra error messages for legitimate declarations.  Fixed InlineFunctions not traversing function declarations in global block scopes, as shown in CommandLineRunnerTest.  Verified that these changes don't introduce code size regression after each pass. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=101978836
