  [NTI] Handle function types with complex nominal and receiver types.  Mostly a refactoring. New functionality: - Warn when the nominal/receiver type annotation doesn't make sense - Slight change in FunctionType#isSubtypeOf for receiver types - Bugfix for qmarkfunctions - Catching some new warnings in the existing unit tests by knowing the more precise type  In a follow-up CL, I'll make @this override the receiver type of the prototype. ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=105441709
