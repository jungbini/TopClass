 Get the ES6_TYPED transpiler mostly working on real inputs. After this change, we can transpile the closure string library and run through the TypeScript compiler with only a handful of errors (which are all legit and not a bug in the transpiler). - Don't print 'undefined' or 'null' types; these are not legal in TypeScript. - Retain the ability to represent the nullability of a type in our type AST. However, my transpiler doesn't create those nodes, so the CodeGenerator doesn't need to encounter nodes which shouldn't be printed. - Restore tests for printing ES6_TYPED language constructs which aren't yet round-trip parseable. This work was de-scoped from a previous CL. These tests are in a new file, which is intended to be replaced with a round-trip-style test. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=85454058
