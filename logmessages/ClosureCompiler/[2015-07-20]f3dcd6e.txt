  Failure callback has an optional second param for error code.  From https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/webstore#type-ErrorCode: > This function is invoked when inline installation does not successfully complete. Possible reasons for this include the user canceling the dialog, the linked item not being found in the store, or the install being initiated from a non-verified site. > > If you specify the failureCallback parameter, it should be a function that looks like this: > > function(string error, ErrorCode errorCode) {...}; > string	error > The failure detail. You may wish to inspect or log this for debugging purposes, but you should not rely on specific strings being passed back. > > ErrorCode	(optional) errorCode > The error code from the stable set of possible errors. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=98705798
