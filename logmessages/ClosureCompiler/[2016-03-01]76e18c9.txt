  Don't warn about missing requires on namespaces defined in the same file.  Adding a goog.require wouldn't be a way of fixing these cases anyway.  This is particularly important as we switch to code using modules. e.g. It doesn't make sense to ask for a require of FooBar.Subclass for the following code: function FooBar() {}; FooBar.Subclass = makeConstructor(); new FooBar.Subclass(); ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=116063490
