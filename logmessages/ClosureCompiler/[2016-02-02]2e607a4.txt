 Fix Maven build and test  "mvn test" is failing. We cannot use both Guava 19.0 and 20.0-SNAPSHOT after https://github.com/google/guava/commit/1ef638f369964c1d1f56bd0ae588535c6abd99a4 See https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2380.  Fix by bumping Guava to 20.0-SNAPSHOT in pom-main.xml.  Remove reference to Guava 19 from README.md.  Remove conflicting import statement and duplicate testGlobJs*() methods from CommandLineRunnerTest.java to fix the Maven build.
