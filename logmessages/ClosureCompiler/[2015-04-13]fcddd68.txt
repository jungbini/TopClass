  Automated g4 rollback of changelist 90849644.  *** Reason for rollback ***  This change breaks some of the regression tests. I think it's better to rollback for now, and then fix up any remaining bugs before resubmitting.  *** Original change description ***  [NEW TYPE INFERENCE] Create pass that converts new types to old types after type inference.  This allows the type-aware compiler passes to work with NTI without being converted to TypeI. (Thus, conversion to TypeI can be done gradually). For this CL, I only looked at CheckAccessControls. In later CLs I will enable NTI on the unit tests of other type-aware passes.  *** ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=91036587
