  Fix forward breakage which changed the output language of transpiled bundled files from ES5 to ES5_STRICT, causing 'use strict' directives to be added and breaking tests that previously worked.  We'll fix the broken tests and then switch this back to strict so that future tests won't have bad code creep in anymore.  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=139612373
