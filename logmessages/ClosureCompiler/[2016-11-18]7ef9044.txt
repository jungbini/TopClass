  Automated g4 rollback of changelist 139602401.  *** Reason for rollback ***  breaks jdossier because it introduces a binary incompatibility and jdossier is built against one version of rhino and runs against head... which is sad and should be fixed  *** Original change description ***  Change UnionType to hold a List instead of a Collection for the alternates and switch most accessors to do indexed iteration.  heap profiling showed that the iteration in JsType.checkEquivalenceHelper was allocating lots of iterators. This is an easy, if slightly annoying, way to make these operations a little cheaper.  ***  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=139623208
