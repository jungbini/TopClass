  Fixed bug 261: http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/issues/detail?id=261 Made JUnit test failure in Ant result in Ant failure (previously Ant printed BUILD SUCCESSFUL even when a test failed, thereby masking the failure).  git-svn-id: https://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@485 b0f006be-c8cd-11de-a2e8-8d36a3108c74
