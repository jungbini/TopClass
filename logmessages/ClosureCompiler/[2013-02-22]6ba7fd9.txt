  Put change handler in Loop. Currently, the same handler is used by all passes. This is a bug, named passes don't reset the handler so once it changes it stays there until the next PhaseOptimizer is created. The message in the tracer is used by no-one. The handler is never removed when the PhaseOptimizer is no longer needed (tiny mem leak). ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=42965629
