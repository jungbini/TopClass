  Fix bugs around ES5 options.  (1) Compiler.acceptEcmascript5() is false when the input language is ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT (2) --checkEs5Strict does not change the input language from ECMASCRIPT3.  These fixes required changing CompilerOptions.checkEs5Strict from a public property to a private property accessed by setters and getters.
