  Fix ExtractPrototypeMembers so that it uses a fixed variable names, so that it doesn't break normalization. As it turns out, JSTestC uses anonymous function naming. those anonymous function names are so long that it starts to blow out the browser's JsVM. They need prototype extraction to make the names shorter. (maybe this anonymous function "naming" is part of the cause of gmail's development woes? we should follow up to see how they're using it.)
