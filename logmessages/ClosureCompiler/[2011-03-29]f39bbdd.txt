  Fix a nasty bug in collapseproperties. The problem is that the declaration-updater conflates "can i always collapse this name?" with "can i sometimes collapse children of this name?" There are a few rare cases where they are not equivalent, like if you have /** @constructor */ a.b.c = function() {}; where a is collapsed and a.b.c is collapsed (because constructors are always collapsed), but a.b is not.
