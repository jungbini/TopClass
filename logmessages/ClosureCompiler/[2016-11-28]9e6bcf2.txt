  Linter fix mode: Remove extra requires that use the "shorthand" goog.module style.  The fix conflicts with the existing fix for REFERENCE_TO_SHORT_IMPORT_BY_LONG_NAME_INCLUDING_SHORT_NAME. When both errors are present, apply the REFERENCE_TO_SHORT_IMPORT_BY_LONG_NAME_INCLUDING_SHORT_NAME fix rather than the extra-require one.  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=140381714
