  Fix a bunch of random stuff with the new Parser wiring including: - add a hacked up JSDoc attachment until dimvar can port his pass - correctly parse numbers - fix a bunch of source location issues  This fixes the bulk of the unit tests.  I'm almost at the point we can start filing bugs for the remaining issues and start on adding ES6 features to our internal AST. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=60014068
