  requires check: If there is no prefix of the namespace that looks like a class name, fall back to the parent of the namespace instead of the entire namespace.  For instance, if there is a missing require for goog.labs.userAgent.platform.isChromeOS, report that "goog.labs.userAgent.platform" is the missing namespace. For most Closure-style code this will produce the expected fix. ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=120238461
