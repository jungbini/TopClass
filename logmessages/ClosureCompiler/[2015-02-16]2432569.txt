  The CompilerTestCase.test(String, String, DiagnosticType) overload never uses the second string argument, the underlying test() call only checks the error.  This CL renames the overload to testError to make the method's intent clearer, and drops the second String argument (as it's ultimately unused). It also fixes up the (surprisingly large number of) test cases that try to pass a second argument.  This also removes the very rarely used testSame(String[], ...) methods that have the same problem. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=86418636
