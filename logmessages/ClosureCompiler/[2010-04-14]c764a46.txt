  Change on 2010/04/13 by john  Here is a crazy thought, let's not require the JSTypeRegistry during parsing.  There are basically two changes here: 1) The IRFactory was looking for enums to seed the JSTypeRegistry, so we do that when we setup for type interence. 2) The JSDocParser was checking the types of @defines objects, now do that during ProcessDefines.
