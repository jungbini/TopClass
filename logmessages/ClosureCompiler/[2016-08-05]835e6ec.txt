  Add return type definition for function defined in extern files.  In normal closure code, function without any return type are considered by the JsCompiler to return undefined. In externs,  function without any return type are considered to return an unknown type. This unknown type disables type checking for the returning object.  This CL fixes all functions without return type defined in the common extern files  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=129439136
