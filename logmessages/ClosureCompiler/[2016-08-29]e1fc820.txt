  Removing Eclipse classpath and project files,  which still referred to the lib folder removed when Ant support was dropped. Updating readme to direct users to build their eclipse config with Maven and to manually fix the build path. Ignoring all Eclipse .classpath and .project files. Missing git ignore for /bin. Updating readme to include instructions to set up the Google style guide in Eclipse to avoid inadvertently creating PRs with tabs instead of spaces, for example.
