  Delete the "es6.js" in contrib/externs/ and move all the definitions there in to the main "es6.js"  Some unparsable type annotations in the contrib/ version were fixed, and some properties that are not yet implemented in Chrome were removed.  Roll-forward of cl/99492958 with more duplicates removed. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=99681222
