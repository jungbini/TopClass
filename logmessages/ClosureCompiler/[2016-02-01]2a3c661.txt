  Fixes a bug in the externs file for the more recent version of google maps api. The bug has a number of facets to it. * The source js file declares a parameter type of {?function(...T)}, but in fact that isn't really accurate. It's more of a function that takes an arbitrary number of arbitrary types, notof one type. * The tooling that auto generates the externs file incorrectly turns the above (wrong though I think it is) into {?function(?)}, so now we can't use the API when passing in a handler that takes more than one parameter (as the one for the "set_at" event does. ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=113593397
