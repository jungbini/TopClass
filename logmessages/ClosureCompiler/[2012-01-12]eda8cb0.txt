  Massive fixup for Typed Array externs.  * Removed WebGLArray/co - they haven't existed in a very long time, and are not in any shipping browser * Added ArrayBuffer.slice * Added Uint8ClampedArray * Removed the TypedArray type, as it doesn't exist (spec is a little vague on this) - a good side effect is that now all of the subarray methods are properly typed (so no longer a need to cast the results)  Moving to html5.js, as the Typed Array spec is now getting used from more places (ArrayBuffer was already in html5.js), and even supported by IE.
