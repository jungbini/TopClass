  Adding @nosideeffects and @throws to many exports that were missing them. All of the ones fixed here were noticed causing extra statements to be included in real code.  Added to: - Function.bind - JSON parse/stringify - Performance API getters - Blob ctors/slicing - Typed Array constructors and slicing (this was causing quite a few spurious ';new Float32Array(4);'s in my compiled code) - Canvas creates and gets; they change no state on the canvas - WebGL creates and gets; also change no state and commonly sit in asserts  @throws was added to functions that are defined in the ECMAScript or their respective W3C spec to throw exceptions.
