  Automated g4 rollback of changelist 127378544.  *** Reason for rollback ***  Produces too many errors which are not worth fixing  *** Original change description ***  Add explicit checks for a goog.provide()d name being defined multiple times, or being defined inside a function instead of at the top level.  We already check for these in ConstCheck but that check will stop working when we move ConstCheck from optimizations to checks.  *** ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=127582799
