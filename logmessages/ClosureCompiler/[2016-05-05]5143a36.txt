  Fix bug when symbols from goog.module files with declareLegacyNamespace lose references.  Such goog.module provide both kinds of symbols: module (module$exports$x$y$z.foo) and legacy (x.y.z). When building SymbolTable we must carefully process all symbols from leaf to roots and we do it by lexigraphically ordering them. But with goog.module it might be a problem because some symbols start with module$exports and some with actual module name. This cl fixes ordering by putting all module$exports symbols before all other symbols.  This bug affects only modules that start with "n" and later. Everything before "m" should not be affected. ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=121599240
