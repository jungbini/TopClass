  Automated g4 rollback.  *** Reason for rollback ***  gmail is fixed  *** Original change description ***  Automated g4 rollback.  *** Reason for rollback ***  gmail is complaining  *** Original change description ***  Namespaces created by jscompiler should be @const. This helps type-checking a lot, because it doesn't have to worry about someone re-assigning the namespace. If you want a namespace to be non-const, you can just declare it explicitly.
