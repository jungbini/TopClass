 Fix types of externs related to Element.  This CL makes following changes in the core JavaScript externs to comply standards: - Document.prototype.getElementById is now returning Element instead of HTMLElement. - The classList attribute is present in the Element instead of HTMLElement. - The classList attribute value is not nullable. - SVGSVGElement.prototype.getElementById returns nullable instance of Element.
