  Automated g4 rollback of changelist 133907989.  *** Reason for rollback ***  Looks to break many projects that don't @export their enums properly.  They should be fixed before rolling forward.  *** Original change description ***  Fix enum type references in generated externs  When a generated extern referenced an enum type in a parameter or record type, the primitive underlying the enum was being used instead of the enum itself.  For example, this code:  /** @enum {number} */ var E = { A: 1, B: 2 }; /** * @param {function(E)} takesEnum * @param {E} e */ function f(takesEnum, e) { takesEnum(e); }  Would become this in the generated externs for the library:  /** @enum {number} */ var E = { A: 1,...  ***  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=134014826
