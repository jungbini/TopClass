Fix for Issue 137  R=nick DELTA=6  (2 added, 2 deleted, 2 changed)  Change on 2010/04/22 by mark  Various delegate fixes.  Give the delegate proxy a name unique from the delegate base so that InstanceObjectType#equals distinguishes them. This is necessary for AmbiguateProperties to work.  Fix the prototype of the delegate proxy. This makes DisambiguateProperties continue to work.  Add superclass methods of the delegate base to the delegate proxy.
