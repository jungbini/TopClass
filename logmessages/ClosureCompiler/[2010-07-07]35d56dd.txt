This is just a code style change, this are no uses that should have any performance impact.  R=acleung DELTA=30  (0 added, 2 deleted, 28 changed)  Change on 2010/07/07 11:56:02 by johnlenz  Reduce the memory cost of generating source maps by reducing the number of property structure objects that are created.  We do this by taking advantage of the fact the property list objects are immutable and can be shared between Nodes.  The source file prop is then shared between every Node in the AST for a given source file, reducing the the number of property nodes used to store this information from O(ast-nodes) to O(source-files).
