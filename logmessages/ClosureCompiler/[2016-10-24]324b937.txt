  Use the isStrictModeInput compiler option when creating the parser Config.  This is a mostly no-op change to make sure the isStrictModeInput option is applied consistently. This technically fixes a bug, but it only affected ECMASCRIPT7 and ECMASCRIPT8 if you tried to specify non-strict-mode input, so I doubt anyone noticed.  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=137101171
