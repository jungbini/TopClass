  Fixes issue 756. http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/issues/detail?id=756 The bug was that a START_OF_EXPR context is passed downward to the object literal, so parentheses are inserted. The addExpr function was clearing only the IN_FOR_INIT_CLAUSE context, but it's safe to clear all contexts, so I did. The function clearContextForNoInOperator is no longer needed, so I removed it. I also deleted the old regression-test script.  R=nicksantos,johnlenz DELTA=87  (1 added, 84 deleted, 2 changed)   Revision created by MOE tool push_codebase.
