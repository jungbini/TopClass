  Add ErrorToFixMapper which maps JSErrors to SuggestedFixes. For example, a "missing require" error will produce a SuggestedFix which adds the necessary goog.require() call.  This will allow us to run the compiler, gather SuggestedFixes for every warning it reports, and apply those fixes automatically. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=80527751
