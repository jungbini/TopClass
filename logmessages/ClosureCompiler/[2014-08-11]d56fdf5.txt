  [NEW TYPE INFERENCE] Fix enum-related bugs.  1) Resolve all qualified enums. A qualified enum that is not used was not being resolved, and as a result we couldn't detect invalid enum properties. (Unused qualified typedefs are also not being resolved, but AFAICT it doesn't matter.)  2) Move addition of enums to locals to the very end, b/c when enums are used as namespaces we need to examine the types defined on the namespace first. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=72941341
