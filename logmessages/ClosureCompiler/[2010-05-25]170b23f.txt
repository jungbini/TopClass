R=acleung DELTA=1  (0 added, 1 deleted, 0 changed)  Change on 2010/05/24 by johnlenz  The ReplaceDebugStrings pass folds "new Error" to "Error", I don't want this in the general version of that pass so add it in a general fold to FoldConstants.  It should be in the "reshaping pass" when FoldConstants in refactored.  R=acleung DELTA=90  (68 added, 0 deleted, 22 changed)  Change on 2010/05/24 by nicksantos  Delete SymbolTable. I was never able to make this approach work. The savings were marginal and not worth the extra complexity.
