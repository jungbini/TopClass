  Get rid of unnecessary []'s in function type annotations. Annotations such as  @type {function(...[Foo])}  are rewritten as  @type {function(...Foo)}  The []'s are no longer necessary as of the r20141103 compiler release, and getting rid of them entirely will allow us to add support for "tuples" (heterogeneous fixed-length arrays) in the future. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=82746936
