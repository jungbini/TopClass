  Fix typo in eval call in ClosureBundler.  The code currently does:  (0,eval("..."));  which is a "direct eval call" (See http://ecma262-5.com/ELS5_HTML.htm#Section_10.4.2 for details). I believe the intention was do an indirect call to get a global eval:  (0,eval)("...");  Since we weren't using a global eval before, it would be safer to just remove the "0," to maintain the same behavior, but I believe doing the indirect call is the prefered solution, since it more directly simulates the list of <script> tags.  For example if a function wrapper was added or a "use strict" was added to the outer script, this wold cause these direct eval calls to have separate execution contexts, and functions/variables could not be shared (in fact this is probably why change cr/93455279 was done, the "use strict" broken because of this eval bug). ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=103319411
