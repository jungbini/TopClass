  Avoid exponential time parsing of potential destructuring expressions.  This fixes half of issue #1115 (to completely eliminate the lookahead parser, we'll need to also fix the parsing of arrow function parameters vs. parenthisized expressions).  This also fixes an issue with us accepting invalid destructuring syntax of ({x}) = foo; ([]) = bar; which is disallowed in final ES6 standard. ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=103755121
