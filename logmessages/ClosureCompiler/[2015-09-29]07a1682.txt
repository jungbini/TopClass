  Remove remaining major exponential slowdown in parser.  This is the one for determining parenthesized expressions vs. arrow function parameter lists.  There is still one remaining usage of the lookahead parser, but that is only for ES6_TYPED type parsing, which is not a code path used for normal JS code.  Fixes #1115, fixes #1049, fixes #1148 ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=104249257
