  Fix JsFileParser to correctly handle goog.module() call on same line as goog.loadModule().  Before this fix, the parser would interpret it as an unwrapped module, rather than a wrapped module. Most source files have blank lines before goog.module, so this issue did not come up very frequently.  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=137981148
