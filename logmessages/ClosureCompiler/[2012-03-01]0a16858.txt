  Fixes a bug whereby lines cut by the code printer b/w identifier chars could be incorrectly uncut, eg, instanceof\nfoo -> instanceoffoo. This fix leaves a space where the cut was. Ideally we would only leave this space when absolutely necessary, though the cost of it is low.  R=acleung DELTA=11  (4 added, 1 deleted, 6 changed)   Revision created by MOE tool push_codebase.
