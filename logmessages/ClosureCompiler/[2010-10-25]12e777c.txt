  Fix a bug in prototype-resolution. The implicit prototype wouldn't get resolved correctly, because we were resolving the "default" slot for the implicit prototypes. InstanceObjectType overrides this own slot with its own implementation, so we really need to use the getter to get the correct slot. This only comes up with very deep inheritance hierarchies (>= 5).
