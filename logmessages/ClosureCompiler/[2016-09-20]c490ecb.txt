  Adds the --create_externs_from_exports flag, which allows the creation of externs from exported methods.  Also fixes a minor bug in AbstractCommandLineRunner that prevented the use of that flag with relative paths containing no separators.  Finally, changes the way generated externs are sorted so that they respect dependency order. Alphabetical sorting is still used, but only within a script. This is important for the generated externs of a large project to be used directly without editing.
