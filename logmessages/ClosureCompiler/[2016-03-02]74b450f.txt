  Change several C-style array declarations to Java-style ones.  According to https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.3.2-array-declarations, C-style array declarations aren't allowed.  There are still a couple of C-style array declarations left. Two in src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/gwt/super/java/util/BitSet.java and one in src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/parsing/parser/util/format/SimpleFormat.java, but since the former is being backported to GWT 2.8 and the latter needs a thorough style cleanup anyway, I'm not fixing them now.
