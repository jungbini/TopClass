  Use super.apply(this, arguments) in constructors automatically generated by Es6ConvertSuper.  Minor fixes were required in TypeInference and NewTypeInference for this.  This will allow all handling of constructor transpilation to be done in Es6ConvertSuperConstructorCalls. This is desirable for consistency and because type information and scope information are available to that later pass.
