  Merge pull request #1551  Fix class name not properly scoped to CLASS  We need to treat CLASS as a root for a block scope possibly containing just the "class name" declaration.  See "classScope" in: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-runtime-semantics-classdefinitionevaluation  Add a few unit tests regarding class names and function names.  Note that our transpilation doesn't support referring to the class name in a method body yet. Eg:  var Clazz = class Foo { bar() { return new Foo; } };  is currently transpiled to:  /**@constructor @struct */var Clazz = function() { }; Clazz.prototype.bar = function() { return new Foo; };  which does not work at runtime. This will be fixed later.  Part of the fix to #1546.  Closes #1551 ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=117164456
