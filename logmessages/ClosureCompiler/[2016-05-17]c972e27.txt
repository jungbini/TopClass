  Don't create a binary namespace for legacy modules.  Update module rewriting to not create a binary module name for those modules declared with goog.module.declareLegacyNamespace. This also fixes issues where the wrong goog.exportSymbol name would be generated in some legacy goog.module cases (see the new integration tests). ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=122542046
