  Find suggested fixes for errors during compilation via a new ErrorManager, rather than at the end of compilation.  Doing it at the end may not work, if the AST has changed significantly since the error was reported. Generally, tools that are finding suggested fixes are only running "checks" which don't modify the AST. But the "Closure pass" that processes goog.require/provide statements is part of the "checks" phase and does modify the AST. ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=108056656
