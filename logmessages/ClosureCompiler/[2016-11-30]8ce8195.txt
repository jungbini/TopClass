  Add a suggested fix that rewrites  goog.module('some.module');  goog.require('x.y.Z');  use(x.y.Z);  to  goog.module('some.module');  const Z = goog.require('x.y.Z');  use(Z);  This fix is not fool-proof (e.g. if there's already an existing variable called Z in the module, this will produce a conflict) but I suspect it will be useful in auto-fixing a lot of existing violations to unblock []  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=140658229
