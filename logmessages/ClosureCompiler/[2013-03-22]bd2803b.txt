  Fix bug in MinimizeExitPoints with removing breaks inside finally blocks.  According to the ECMAScript standard, a finally should only resume an exception if it exits without a break, continue, return, or another throw.  This change does unfortunately not yet fix issue 936 because the same bug exists in UnreachableCodeElimination. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=44335812
