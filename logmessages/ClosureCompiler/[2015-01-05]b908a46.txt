  The outline of this change is: - Define a new Analyzer for JavaScript that wraps the JsFlume and RefasterJs templates. - Register the JsFlume and RefasterJs templates that wish to be run in the JsFlumeAnalyzer class. - Add support to SuggestedFix for returning the original matched node that caused the suggested fix to be created.  As a first example, I added support for the fix_throw_error.js RefasterJs template to the JS robot comments. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=83267978
