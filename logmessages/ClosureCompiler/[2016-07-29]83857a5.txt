  Stop guerrilla-patching Object.keys and friends.  Previously we monkey-patched them to try to fix Symbol so that Object.keys and Object.getOwnPropertyNames would not return polyfilled symbols, nor would they return the hidden WeakMap property.  In practice, as long as Symbols show up in exacly one of getOwnPropertyNames and getOwnPropertySymbols, we're probably okay.  Given that the guerrilla patches (a) add a lot more code, and (b) increase complexity and brittleness significantly, it's probably best to not do it here.  RELNOTES: Update transpile.js to stop monkey-patching property accessors.  ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=128840791
