  [NEW TYPE INFERENCE] Turn on default externs for unit tests.  Also fix associated failures: * @struct/@dicts should not warn for subclassing Object (even though it isn't @struct/@dict) * Don't give NON_NUMERIC_ARRAY_INDEX warning for loose objects (they are subclasses of Array, but we shouldn't treat them as real Arrays) ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=74157370
