  Various fixes for compliance with HTTP/2 spec  Motivation:  A few items were identified where the http2 codec is out of compliance with the spec.  Modifications:  - Fixed handling of priority weight on the wire. Now adding 1 after reading from the wire and subtracing 1 before writing.  - Fixed handling of next stream ID. Client streamIds were starting at 3, but they need to start at 1 to allow the upgrade from HTTP/1.1. Also making next stream ID logic more flexible. Allowing the next created stream to be any number in the sequence following the previously created stream.  - Disallowing SETTINGS frames with ENABLE_PUSH specified for server endpoints. This means that attempts to write this frame from a server, or read it from a client will fail.  Result:  The http2 implementation will be more inline with the spec.
