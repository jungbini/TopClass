  [#1310] Fix deadlock which can happen if limit of MemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor was exceed and a close is triggered by a write  * Close must be handled from outside the write lock to fix a possible deadlock which can happen when MemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor is used and the limit is exceed and a close is triggered while the lock is hold. This is because the close(..) may try to submit a task to handle it via the ExecutorHandler which then deadlocks.
