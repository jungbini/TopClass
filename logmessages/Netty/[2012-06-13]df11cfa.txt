  Introduce a FrameDecoder.setMaxCumulationBufferCapacity(..) setter which allows to configure how bug the capacity of the cumulation buffer can be before the FrameDecoder tries to optimize memory usage with byte copies. Related to #390 This allows the users to set a threshold that matches best their needs. Use Integer.MAX_VALUE to disable copies at all at the cost of bigger memory usage.
