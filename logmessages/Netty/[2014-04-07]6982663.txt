  Adding examples for HTTP/2 framing.  Motivation:  Provide some example code to show how to bootstrap client and server for use with HTTP/2 framing.  Modifications:  - Fixed Http2ConnectionHandler to allow headers after stream creation. Needed for response headers.  - Added toString() to all frame classes to help with debugging/logging  - Added example classes for HTTP/2  Result:  HTTP/2 connections now properly support response headers. Examples for HTTP/2 provided with the distribution of examples module.  After your change, what will change.
