  fix the issue netty#2944 in 4.0 #4809  Motivation:  fix the issue netty#2944  Modifications:  (1) use - instead of =>, use ! instead of :> due to the connection is bidirectional. What's more, toString() method don't know the direction or there is no need to know the direction when only log channel information. (2) add L before local address and R: before remote address.  Result:  after the fix, toString() won't confuse the user.
