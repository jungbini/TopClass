  [#2931] Only cancel SelectionKey if connection is not pending  Motivation:  We must only cancel the SelectionKey if the connection is not pending while try to workaround the epoll bug, otherwise we may fail to notify the future later.  Modifications:  Check if the connection is pending before cancel the SelectionKey.  Result:  Only cancel correct SelectionKeys and so also make sure the futures are notified.
