  Introduced HTTP/2 frame to HTTP/1.x translation layer.  Motivation:  The HTTP/2 codec currently provides direct callbacks to access stream events/data. The HTTP/2 codec provides the protocol support for HTTP/2 but it does not pass messages up the context pipeline. It would be nice to have a decoder which could collect the data framed by HTTP/2 and translate this into traditional HTTP type objects. This would allow the traditional Netty context pipeline to be used to separate processing concerns (i.e. HttpContentDecompressor).  It would also be good to have a layer which can translate FullHttp[Request|Response] objects into HTTP/2 frame outbound events.  Modifications:  Introduce a new InboundHttp2ToHttpAdapter and supporting classes which will translate HTTP/2 stream events/data into HttpObject objects. Introduce a new DelegatingHttp2HttpConnectionHandler which will translate FullHttp[Request|Response] objects to HTTP/2 frame events.  Result:  Introduced HTTP/2 frame events to HttpObject layer. Introduced FullHttp[Request|Response] to HTTP/2 frame events. Introduced new unit tests to support new code. Updated HTTP/2 client example to use new code. Miscelaneous updates and bug fixes made to support new code.
