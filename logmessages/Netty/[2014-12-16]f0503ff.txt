  Prevent the potential concurrency hazard of the initialization in AbstractNioBoss(Worker)Pool.  Motivation: During the reading of the source codes of Netty 3.9.5.Final, I thought there might have a lurking concurrency bug in the AbstractNioBossPool#init method, of which a single volatile variable cannot correctly control the initialization sequence happened exactly only once under concurrency environment. Also I found there's already a much more elegant and concurrency safe way to do the work like this, I decided to make this PR. (Please refer to the discussion in https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3249.)  Modifications: Change the type of the variable that control the initialization from "volatile boolean" to "final AtomicBoolean".  Result: The potential concurrency hazard of the initialization in AbstractNioBoss(Worker)Pool will be eliminated.
