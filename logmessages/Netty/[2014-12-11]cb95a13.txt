  Suppress channelReadComplete until MessageAggregator completes aggregating a message. https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3168  Motivation: This fixes issue 3168 where HttpObjectAggregator does not suppress channelReadComplete() when aggregation is not yet finished.  Modifications: Ignore channelReadComplete until a message completes aggregation. MessageAggregator currently tracks the currentMessage being aggregated. This variable transitions to non-null when aggregation begins and back to null when aggregation completes or fails. When the currentMessage is null, it is safe to issue a channelReadComplete because the corresponding channelRead will have completed aggregation.  Result: channelReadComplete will only fire one time on each completed message aggregation.
