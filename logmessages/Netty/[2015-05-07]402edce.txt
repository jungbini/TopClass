  Validate cookie name and value characters  Motivation:  RFC6265 specifies which characters are allowed in a cookie name and value.  Netty is currently too lax, which can used for HttpOnly escaping.  Modification:  Backport new RFC6265 compliant Cookie parsers in cookie subpackage. Deprecate old Cookie encoders and decoders that will be dropped in 5.0.  Result:  The problem described in the motivation section is fixed.
