  Fixing HTTP/2 data write completion bug  Motivation:  A recent refactoring of the outbound flow controller interface introduced a bug when writing data. We're no longer properly handling the completion of the write (i.e. updating stream state/handling error).  Modifications:  Updated AbstractHttp2ConnectionHandler.writeData to properly handle the completion of the write future.  Result:  DATA writes now perform post-write cleanup.
