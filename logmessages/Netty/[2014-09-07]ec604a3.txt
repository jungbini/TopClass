  Handler Unit Test Bug  Motivation: There is a bug in the JettySslEngineTest where the interface receiving a message does not do a latch.countDown(). This causes each test to be subject to the CountDownLatch timeout period instead of being notified right when an event occurs.  Modifications: - The JettySslEngineTest message handler will call the appropriate latch.countDown after a message is received  Result: JettySslEngineTest will not be subject to waiting the timeout period even if the message is correctly received
