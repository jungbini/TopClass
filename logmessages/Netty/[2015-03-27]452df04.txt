  Always fire interestChanged from IO thread  Motivation:  The documented thread model stipulates that all upstream events should be fired from the IO thread, which is crucial to avoid race conditions.  See #3546  Modifications:  Change AbstractNioChannel.WriteQueue to check if the current thread is the IO thread of the worker and call fireInterestChangedLater accordingly.  Result:  interestChanged event is always fired from IO thread of channel thus honoring the documented thread model and fixing race conditions.
