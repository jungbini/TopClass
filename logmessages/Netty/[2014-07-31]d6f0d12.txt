  Fix a bug in ChannelOutboundBuffer.nioBuffers()  Related issue: #2717, #2710, #2704, #2693  Motivation:  When ChannelOutboundBuffer.nioBuffers() iterates over the linked list of entries, it is not supposed to visit unflushed entries, but it does.  Modifications:  - Make sure ChannelOutboundBuffer.nioBuffers() stops the iteration before it visits an unflushed entry - Add isFlushedEntry() to reduce the chance of the similar mistakes  Result:  Another regression is gone.
