  Do not decode a cookie value with mismatching quotes  Motivation:  The following cookie key-value pair should not be decoded:  a='b;c=d  .. because it is invalid.  Currently, a missing closing quote will make the CookieDecoder decode "'b;c=d" as a value.  This can be a problem when 'c=d' is something you don't want to expose.  Modification:  Discard the cookie key-value pair when it has no matching quote.  Result:  The problem described in the motiviation section is fixed.
