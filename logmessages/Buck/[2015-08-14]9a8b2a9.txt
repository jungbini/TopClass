  Fix watchman glob when symlinks are globbed  Summary: When I fixed the watchman glob matching directories, I inadvertently broke it matching symlinks (since watchman doesn't follow symlinks).  I plan on fixing this in Watchman, but for now, this is a short-term fix to assume symlinks which match a glob are files (and not directories).  Test Plan: buck build //path/to:lib in repo with glob matching symlink
