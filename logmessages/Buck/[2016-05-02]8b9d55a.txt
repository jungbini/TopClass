  Upgrade ant build to ecj 4.6M6 and immutables 2.1.28  Summary: This upgrades the Buck `ant` build to use the Eclipse compiler `ecj-4.6M6` and the Immutables.org value type generator `2.1.28`.  Previously, we used `javac` from the `ant` build to generate immutable value types, because `ecj`'s annotation processor was hopelessly broken.  The Eclipse team recently fixed the last of the issues blocking us:  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=492761  This means we can now use `ecj` for the entire `ant` build instead of using `javac` for the annotation processor and `ecj` for the rest.  That means I was able to delete the `check-immutables` and `generate-immutables` targets from `build.xml`, which means:  1) We no longer will see weird errors with the `ant` build on incremental builds after rebasing (these were due to subtle caching issues in `check-immutables`)  2) We should see better behavior when introducing typos into Java files used by immutable value types (we're using the same compiler for everything now)  3) The `ant` build is about 20-25% faster  Note I wasn't able to use `ecj-4.6M7`; it appears the `ant` bridge was broken in that version. I filed Eclipse bug 492858 on this:  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=492858  Finally, I removed the `eclipse-project` target from `build.xml` since it's no longer needed with Eclipse 4.7M7 or later.  Test Plan: `rm -rf build && ant && touch build/successful-build && buck build buck`  Reviewed By: bolinfest  fb-gh-sync-id: ae3383f fbshipit-source-id: ae3383f
