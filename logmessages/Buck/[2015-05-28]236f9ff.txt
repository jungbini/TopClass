  [apple test] Fix OS X logic and app tests  Summary: I had a `TODO` in `AppleTestDescription` to stop hard-coding `iphonesimulator` as the SDK.  When I fixed this, I found a bug in `xctool` where it threw an exception when trying to chdir to a nil directory when running OS X logic or app tests directly from a built binary.  I fixed the bug and sent a pull request upstream which I merged:  https://github.com/facebook/xctool/pull/519  This updates our local copy of the binary to include the fix and adds integration tests to build and run OS X logic and app test.  Test Plan: Integration tests included. `ant java-test -Dtest.class=AppleTestIntegrationTest`
