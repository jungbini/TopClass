  fix combined tests referencing test libs  Summary: When retrieving test library archives for linking combined tests, the actual tests that comprise the larger test was ignored due to dynamic type checks.  Here we include them explicitly, and compute their `PBXFileReference` directly using a new code-path where they are treated as libraries.  Test Plan: CI, unit test now check that test libs are linked.
