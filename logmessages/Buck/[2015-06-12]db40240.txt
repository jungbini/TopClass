  Explicitly pass build SDK version to Apple linker with -sdk_version flag  Summary: Apple ships SDKs with pathnames like:  Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator.sdk  and includes a symbolic link with a version number in the name pointing to the SDK:  Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator8.3.sdk  Previously, `AppleSdkDiscovery` filtered out any such symbolic links, since we didn't want to include the same SDK twice.  Unfortunately, I found that `clang` actually parses the pathname to the SDK to discover the compatibility version to encode in the binary:  https://gist.github.com/bgertzfield/672765c087e7f19e2b0e  This flag toggles on and off various runtime behaviors, and in particular is how iOS chooses between iOS 6 and iOS 7 styling.  We confirmed in the source of Apple's `ld64` tool that this behavior holds if you don't pass `-sdk_version` to the linker:  http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/ld64/ld64-241.9/src/ld/Options.cpp  This
