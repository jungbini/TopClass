  rust: use params.appendExtraDeps()  Summary: RustNativeLinkables.addNativeDependencies() was using copyWith(), but this had the effect of moving all the extraDeps into declaredDeps. I'm not this was a real bug since all the deps were preserved in some form, but pretty ugly (and maybe a bug if extraDeps is handled separately?).  Use BuildRuleParams.appendExtraDeps() to just extend extraDeps.  Test Plan: CI  Reviewed By: andrewjcg  fbshipit-source-id: 5fb85a7
