  Derive CxxCompilationDatabase from CxxPreprocessAndCompile rules.  Summary: Previously, `CxxCompilationDatabase` performed a traversal over the contents of the `BuildRuleResolver` to find the `CxxPreprocessAndCompile` rules to use for entries in the generated compilation database, as well as for the `HEADER_SYMLINK_TREE_FLAVOR` and `EXPORTED_HEADER_SYMLINK_TREE_FLAVOR` dependencies.  However, running `buck build //path/to:rule#compilation-database` does not ensure that the necessary dependencies get graph-enhanced and included in the action graph, which means they are not guaranteed to end up in the `BuildRuleResolver`. This fixes things so that the appropriate dependencies are added to the action graph and added properly as deps of the `#compilation-database`.  Test Plan: `CxxCompilationDatabaseTest` and `CxxCompilationDatabaseIntegrationTest`.  Note how the `BuildRuleResolver.addToIndex()` calls have been removed from `CxxCompilationDatabaseTest`.
