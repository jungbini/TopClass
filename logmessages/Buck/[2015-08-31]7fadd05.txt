  Use Unix domain sockets instead of TCP/IP to talk to Nailgun  Summary: We found a nasty bug where on IPv6-only servers, Buck failed to talk to any hostnames which resolve to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  To work around this, you have to set a special Java property `java.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true`.  Unfortunately, setting this to `true` also breaks Nailgun in subtle ways (it binds to the IPv6 `localhost`, which `ng.c` doesn't handle).  Since we don't really want to deal with TCP/IP or DNS name resolution at all in Buck, this integrates my Nailgun pull request 71 with Buck:  https://github.com/martylamb/nailgun/pull/71  and reconfigures it to use a local Unix domain socket `.buckd/sock` on which Buck listens.  Test Plan: `buck build buck` on mixed IPv4/IPv6 Mac OS X host and IPv6-only Linux host. Confirmed it was not listening on TCP/IP sockets.  Set `java.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true` on IPv6-only Linux host. Confirmed `buck build buck` worked and could connect to hosts that previously failed.
