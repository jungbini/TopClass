  Add `extendFlavoredBuildTarget` method  Summary: This is similar to `createFlavoredBuildTarget` but accepts build targets which are already flavored, in which case it creates and uses a new flavor formed by concatenating the original flavor and the new flavor.  This is useful for flavored target nodes (e.g. C++ thrift support, C++ debug/optimized build mode support) which uses flavors to name the potentially many build rules it creates (e.g //foo:bar#cpp-libbar.a).  Test Plan: - included tests - used in and thrift C++ support to name build rules
