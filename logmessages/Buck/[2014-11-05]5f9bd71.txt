  Make buck project exclude subdirectories correctly.  Summary: When generating intellij config for a module, buck is supposed to exclude all subdirectories which contain their own BUCK files. This was broken when we introduced InMemoryBuildFileTree (for perf); this fixes it by reverting back to the build file tree that crawls the file system. Also verified that this doesn't regress the project command execution time (because I assume we only call buildFileTree.getChildPaths() for project_config rules).  Test Plan: Integration test.
