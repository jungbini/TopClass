  munger.py optimizations  Summary: Instead of unzipping archive entries from an input jar into a tmp dir and then zipping them back into an output jar, `munger.py` now transfers entries from the first one to the second one on the fly. It reduces `main-fixed` from 110sec to 9sec on windows where opening and closing a lot of files is expensive.  Test Plan: CI, compare build times  Reviewed By: plamenko  fbshipit-source-id: b894005
