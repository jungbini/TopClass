  Change AppleConfig.getAppleSdkPaths() to take ProcessExecutor instead of Console  Summary: Uri suggested this cleanup when reviewing my change "Create AppleCxxPlatforms in KnownBuildRuleTypes".  Doing this allows us to greatly simplify that change. Since we already have access to `ProcessExecutor` in `KnownBuildRuleTypes` and `CompilationDatabase` (but we do not have access to `Console` in `KnownBuildRuleTypes`), there's no need to create a new one in `AppleConfig`.  Passing one down lets us avoid having to schlep a `Console` around.  I also added a new unit test to confirm the behavior in `AppleConfigTest`. When I did this, I realized `AppleConfig` was using the non-testable API of `ProcessExecutor` which takes an already-launched `Process` instance instead of the testable API which takes a `ProcessExeuctorParams`, so I fixed that.  Test Plan: Added new unit test. `ant java-test -Dtest.class=AppleConfigTest`.
