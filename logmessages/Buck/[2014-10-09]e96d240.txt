  Improve logging and exceptions for Parser cache invalidation  Summary: These logs came in handy when diagnosing cache invalidation bug in the parser, especially the HumanReadableException change.  Changing the exception required me to loosen a test, which previously was search the contents of an exception message (which I changed on purpose to make more helpful).  Test Plan: ant test -Dtest.class=com.facebook.buck.parser.ParserTest Set in `.bucklogging.local.properties`:  com.facebook.buck.parser.level = FINER  Confirmed new log messages appeared.
