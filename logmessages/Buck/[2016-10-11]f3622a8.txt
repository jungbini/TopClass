  support for groovy rules in intellij project generation  Summary: Not quite right yet but for your consideration.  This pull request supports `groovy_library` and `groovy_test` rules as intellij source folders.  Outstanding issues: 1. what additional unit or integration tests do you want to see? 2. I'm not sure what `addCompiledShadowIfNeeded()` does but I'm not calling it, should I? 3. there's an unnecessary `<exclude>` and a `packagePrefix` being created in the .iml, any suggestions on the best place to look for a fix?
