  Fix iOS simulator install success message disabling superconsole  Summary: `InstallCommand` currently writes directly to the console's stdout when it succeeds. That disables `SuperConsole`, so we never see the `INSTALLING...FINISHED` line.  This fixes the bug by posting a `ConsoleEvent` with the success message (possibly wrapped in lovely ANSI colors) instead.  Test Plan: `buck install :App` and `buck install -r :App` in Apple repo. Before, `INSTALLING...FINISHED` line didn't appear. Now, it does.  Sorry there isn't a proper unit test. `InstallCommand` is woefully under-tested, and `InstallCommandIntegrationTest` runs with the SuperConsole disabled.
