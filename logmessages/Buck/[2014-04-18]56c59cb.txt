  [buck-ios] include headers in ios_test targets  Summary: Buck is currently not include headers referenced by srcs in ios_test rules, which causes problems for test targets that share helper headers between files (such as FBComposerKit). This fixes that with a similar fix to @jprado's fix for this for the ios_binary rule in D1265561.  Test Plan: built buck, regenerated composer kit xcodeproj, confirmed headers were now included in test target + it built successfully.
