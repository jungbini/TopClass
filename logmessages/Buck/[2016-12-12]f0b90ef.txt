  Use relative paths in header maps for direct header map  Summary: Depfiles.parseAndWriteBuckCompatibleDepfile() failed to find some headers when they were set as absolute paths in DirectHeaderMap.  To mitigate the issue, we use relative paths in header maps for direct header map.  Test Plan: - In Depfiles.parseAndWriteBuckCompatibleDepfile(), add a log to report untracked headers. - Disable symlinks for headers - `buck project [myapp]`  Before change: See reports of untracked headers for headers of our libraries.  After change: These reports disappear.  Note: prefix headers and system headers are still reported as untracked headers.  Reviewed By: yiding  fbshipit-source-id: 2b0c5b0
