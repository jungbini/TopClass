  Do not apply buck test timeouts when running with --debug.  Test Plan: Create .buckconfig.local with: ``` [test] timeout = 10000 # 10 seconds ```  With and without this fix, run `buck test --debug //javatests/com/facebook/resources/impl:impl`, setup a breakpoint in one of the tests, attach the debugger and do not resume execution for at least 10 seconds. Verify that there is no timeout error with this fix.
