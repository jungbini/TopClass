  Fix jackson annotation warnings.  Summary: This fixes warning-spew that gets emitted when building something that includes a class in here that has a jackson annotation. These warnings don't show up unless you have other build errors, at which time it gets annoying since it floods terminal. Apparently the annotation class itself has to be visible at the time the depending package is built.  Test Plan: Compiled something with a build error, didn't see a flood of unrelated stuff.
