  Update build-tools version for Travis  Summary: We hit an issue in Travis where the version of dx from built-tools-v18 doesn't like our java7 class files.  https://travis-ci.org/facebook/buck/builds/23236332 Update to build-tools-v19.0.3 to fix it.  Test Plan: Ran the travis test script locally and saw these failures go away. There was one other seemingly unrelated failure, but it could be a flaky test, not sure yet.
