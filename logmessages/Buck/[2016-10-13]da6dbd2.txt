  Improve heuristics for `buck autodeps`.  Summary: When `org.stringtemplate.v4.ST` is used as a generic in a public method param, it should be treated as an exported dependency rather than assumed to be a template parameter even though it looks like one given its casing.  This fixes an issue that we had to workaround in D4009953.  Test Plan: Added a test case in `JavaFileParserTest` that reproduces the issue.  Reviewed By: mzlee  fbshipit-source-id: 0749dcf
