  Get `buck targets` working on Windows.  Summary: In order to get `buck targets` working, I made 4 modifications: 1. Added jython.cmd as a python intepreter on Windows (through it is rather slow, Windows user do not have to install CPython). 2. Fixed bugs in `buck.py` and now `relpath` works on Windows and POSIX. 3. Replaced some hard coded `/` with `File.separator`. 4. Fixed a bug in `buck.cmd`: now press Ctrl + Break when executing would not change current working directory.  Test Plan: Run `buck targets` in a buck project directory on Windows.
