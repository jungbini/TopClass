  Fix python configuration processing.  Summary: Previously buck would try to use any executable file or directory in its working directory as a python interpreter. It would also silently fall back to finding a python on the PATH if a python path was specified in the config, but invalid. This change fixes both of those problems and adds tests.  Test Plan: 0) buck test --all 1) mkdir python 2) touch BUCK 3) check that "buck build :lolwut" returns the error "BUILD FAILED: No rule found when resolving target //:lolwut in build file //BUCK"
