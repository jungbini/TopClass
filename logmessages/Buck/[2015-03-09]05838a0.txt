  Fix Xcode asset catalog compiler command going over kernel length limit  Summary: When running the asset compiler on a project with hundreds or thousands of `.xcassets` bundles, we could go over the kernel limit on the length of a command line.  We actually hit this in a project:  Foo.build/Script-E1F174220000000000000004.sh: line 3: path/to/compile_asset_catalogs_build_phase.sh: Argument list too long  This fixes the issue by using the `fromfile_prefix_chars` feature of Python `argparse` to allow writing the `Foo.xcassets` paths to a temp file and then passing them to the script using `@filename`:  path/to/compile_asset_catalogs_build_phase.sh @/tmp/args  Test Plan: Added unit test. Confirmed it failed with `ant java-test -Dtest.class=NewNativeTargetProjectMutatorTest`.  Applied patch, re-ran `ant java-test -Dtest.class=NewNativeTargetProjectMutatorTest`, confirmed it passed.
