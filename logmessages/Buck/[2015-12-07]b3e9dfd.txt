  Delete unused method SizeUnit.formatBytes()  Summary: This method is unused. Worse, it uses the default system locale for formatting numbers, so its tests fail when the system locale uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point (say, German).  This deletes the unused method and its tests.  This is a partial fix for https://github.com/facebook/buck/issues/557 .  Test Plan: Applied patch to force tests into German: https://gist.github.com/bhamiltoncx/4b6b5785b9d0ba4132e4  Ran `ant java-test -Dtest.class=SizeUnitTest`, confirmed it failed. Applied this fix, re-ran test, confirmed it passed.  Reviewed By: Coneko  fb-gh-sync-id: 6cba65f
