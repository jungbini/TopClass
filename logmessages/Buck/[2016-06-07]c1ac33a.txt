  Allow DWARF debugging from buck install  Summary: Allow debugging binaries built with DWARF debug format by: 1. Setting the last modification dates of all output files to predefined value "X" 2. Changing last modification dates inside Mach O from 0 to some non-zero value "X" 3. Applying the last modification date to extracted zip entries when unzipping cache objects  I've chosen value "X" to be equal to one from `ZipConstants.java` (12:00:00 AM February 1, 1985). This way the amount of modifications to match them together is minimal.  All these changes will allow  `ld` link the binary correctly (with 1 Jab 1970 `ld` fails to link files for some reason -  it can't read files! //sic!!//) and will make `lldb` to find all object files that Mach O binary consist of.
