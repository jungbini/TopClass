  better handling of build setting prefixed framework paths  Summary: * Adds the ability to prefix frameworks with a known build setting (currently only SOURCE_ROOT, SDKROOT, and BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR). * will now error when generating a project that makes use of a framework path that is prefixed by an unknown build setting.  note that this only catches the error when it is used (in test and binary rules) and not when it is declared (in library rules). Doing that would require the rule themselves be privy to SourceTreePaths, which will likely require some file moving.  Note also that the build setting is evaluated in the context of the dependent rule, not the dependency library in which its declared (since they are simply copied verbatim into the output project). This means that these values, especially those that are unprefixed or prefixed with SOURCE_ROOT, can produce non-intuitive results.  Test Plan: unit test
