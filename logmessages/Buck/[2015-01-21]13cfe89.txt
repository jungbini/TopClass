  [Fix] fix ManifestMerger fail to create XmlFile with #  Summary: There is a bug / feature in `XmlUtils.printXmlFile` which will truncate a file name if it contains `#`. Its kind of valid since `#` is not allowed in XML file name, but we are using `#` as delimiter in buildTarget if it's Flavored. For fixing that, instead of generating the file directly, generate the XmlString first, and then write the data into the file.  Test Plan: 1. build android_manifest under a folder with `#`, output doesn't get truncated 2. arc unit
