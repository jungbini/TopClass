  Buck plugin fix unable to get stub builder error  Summary: Some users get: Assertion failed: unable to get stub builder for com.facebook.buck.intellij.plugin.file.BuckFileType@24a7613a a lot. This is caused by the fact that IntelliJ tries to do [[ http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/indexing_and_psi_stubs/stub_indexes.html | Stub indexing ]] on the BUCK files, but we don't have a stub builder for our file type  Test Plan: I am not able to repro this. But, it should solve the problem, since, now we have a BinaryFileStubBuilder for our file type.  Reviewed By: alsutton  fbshipit-source-id: 1abb9de
