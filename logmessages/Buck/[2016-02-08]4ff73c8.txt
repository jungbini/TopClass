  omnibus: don't include unused always-static libs in libomnibus  Summary: This fixes a minor bug where a library requesting static linkage would get included in the merged libomnibus library even if no other libs in it used it.  This could happen if a root had a dep which marked itself as `link_whole=True`, and no other libs used it.  In this case, we should statically link it into the root and leave it out of libomnibus.  Test Plan: added unittest  Reviewed By: sdwilsh  fb-gh-sync-id: 350ded0
