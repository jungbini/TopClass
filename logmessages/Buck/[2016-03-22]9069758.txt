  De-flake ParsePipelineTest  Summary:The two exceptionOnSwapped* test cases were flakey because the test fixture always enabled speculative parsing of dependencies on a background thread. This was fine for all of the other test cases as they weren't poking at internal state (so didn't have the chance to observe any races). The fix is to run the two tests using a direct executor with no speculation on deps.  Test Plan: CI, ran test locally 10x, didn't flake  Reviewed By: k21  fb-gh-sync-id: 156bc91 shipit-source-id: 156bc91
