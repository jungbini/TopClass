  Fix flipped Boolean logic in SourceTreePath.equals()  Summary: I got a report that ProjectGenerator was missing some files. With the logging in D1495765, I noticed PBXFileReference objects were being re-used for two SourceTreePaths.  I tracked this down to SourceTreePath.equals() having a flipped Boolean operator. I wrote a test to confirm it was broken, and fixing the operator fixed the test as well as the missing files from ProjectGenerator.  Test Plan: Unit test included. Ran 'buck project' to generate Xcode project, confirmed missing files were generated.
