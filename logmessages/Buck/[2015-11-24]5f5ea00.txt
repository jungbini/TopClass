  Work around ar issue on Apple platforms where appending a .o file to an existing archive would overwrite any existing .o of the same name  Summary: When we split a long `ar` invocation into multiple commands via `CommandSplitter`, if a file `foo1/bar.o` already exists in the `.a`, then a second `foo2/bar.o` would overwrite the first leading to undefined symbols.  This only happens when *updating* an existing archive (e.g when the `ar` command is long enough to require splitting).  The fix is to pass in `q` instead of `r` to skip indexing and prevent overwriting the first `foo1/bar.o`  In addition, on GNU `ar`, omitting `s` is needed as well.
