  Fix NulTerminatedCharsetDecoder.Result.equals() and add more tests  Summary: I had a dumb typo in `NulTerminatedCharsetDecoder.Result.equals()` (that'll teach me not to use Immutables).  This fixes the issue and updates the tests to actually use this method. I also added two more tests to confirm behavior of malformed UTF-8 input and an output `CharBuffer` that is too small.  Test Plan: Unit tests updated. `ant java-test -Dtest.class=NulTerminatedCharsetDecoderTest`  Reviewed By: beefon  fbshipit-source-id: 2cf4658
