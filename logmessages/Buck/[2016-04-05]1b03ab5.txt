  Fix Python test filtering  Summary:Test filtering was broken because it was geting the list of tests from `ShellStep`, but `ShellStep` does not make its stdout machine readable and depending on the configuration it might prepend each line with ansi color escape codes, breaking parsing of the list of tests. To fix that, directly use `ProcessExecutor` (and pass it `EXPECTING_STD_OUT`) instead of a `ShellStep`.  Test Plan: `buck test -f '#test_global_help' //programs:test`  Reviewed By: bhamiltoncx  fb-gh-sync-id: f4cb79c fbshipit-source-id: f4cb79c
