  Remove dependencies tests when --without-dependencies-tests is used  Summary: As robbertvanginkel mentioned in https://github.com/facebook/buck/issues/710, this issue is pretty much a bug to be fixed.  This PR will fix that bug as following:  1. When `--without-dependencies-tests` flag is used, test scheme for the specified target should be generated, but not for its dependencies. 2. When `--without-dependencies-tests` flag is not used, test scheme for the specified target should contains all tests of its dependencies (old behavior).
