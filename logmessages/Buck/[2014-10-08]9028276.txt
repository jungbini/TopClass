  Make AbstractAppleNativeTargetBuildRule responsible for its header map location.  Summary: The location of a header map seems like something that should be part of the rule rather than known only to `ProjectGenerator`. This will be even more important when we teach Buck to build iOS.  The various header map suffixes that were hardcoded as strings in `ProjectGenerator` now appear as an enum in `AbstractAppleNativeTargetBuildRule`.  In order to do this refactoring, I had to pass a `BuildRule` as a stronger type, `AbstractAppleNativeTargetBuildRule`, as appropriate, in `ProjectGenerator`. Previously, much of this logic was based on a `BuildTarget` that could have come from any `BuildRule`.  Also moved header maps from `buck-out/path/to/target` to `buck-out/gen/path/to/target`, as that seemed more appropriate. We do not want to have arbitrary subdirectories in `buck-out`.
