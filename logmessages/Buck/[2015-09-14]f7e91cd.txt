  intellij buck plugin can be built by buck  Summary: Make the intellij buck plugin be buildable by buck. This is a prerequisite for the plugin testing framework to work.  Fixed most of the old problems.  Using buck project in the plugin directory will mess things up. Let's use the provided IntelliJ project for now. Generating the parser/lexer files now works, we can debug from within IntelliJ, the plugin can be built by both buck and IntelliJ. Also, you can use the plugin to build the plugin (no debug yet...).  How to:  cd buck/src/com/facebook/buck/intellij/plugin  * check the README files in the various ${plugin-directory}/third-party/java/ directories for the dependencies we don't want to ship/add to version control. * need to use intellij to generate the lexer/parser files. See the next option.  buck build :ideabuck  copy the buck-out/gen/ideabuck.jar to the plugin directories of IntelliJ.  OR  With IntelliJ, load the project at ~/buck/src/com/facebook/buck/intellij/plugin.  Test Plan: See if the above instructions work.
