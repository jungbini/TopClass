  AndroidBinary: fix installation bugs with top-down building  Summary: - The `InstallableApk` interface requires access to the manifest. Since this manifest is provided by a build time dep, we need to keep a copy of it cached with the `AndroidBinary`. - Add exopackage requirements as runtime deps, as these are needed for exopackage to work.  Test Plan: - `buck install ...` with top-down building - `buck test --all`
