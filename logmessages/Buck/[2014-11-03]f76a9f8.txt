  Adds an option for Glob to raise an error when it returns no matches.  Summary: Glob can now raise an error if it returns no matches when called with the allow_empty=False parameter. Default value is allow_empty=True so that existing projects don't break - they'll need to be updated before we can change the default. In the meantime, this introduces the param into the system and exposes the optional functionality to aid with debugging.  Preps the local tests to run cleanly when allow_empty defaults to True.  Test Plan: Built select internal apps and added new unit tests. Buck tests run clean: TESTS PASSED (with some assumption violations)
