  Add exported_deps for Apple shared libraries  Summary: We ran into the following situation:  1) //lib:foo depends on //lib:bar 2) //lib:foo imports a header from //lib:bar and `#define`s a macro including a reference to a symbol from libbar 3) //app:bin depends on //lib:foo and uses the macro  Currently, if //lib:foo and //lib:bar are both built as static libraries, this is no problem; we link in the transitive closure of all dependencies to the final binary.  However, if they're built as dynamic libraries, we fail to link //app:bin, since we only link in its direct dependencies.  To solve this, this
