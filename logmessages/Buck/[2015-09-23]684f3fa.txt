  New config option to forbid symlinks in source file paths  Summary: Currently, Buck's parser cache works on the assumption that a change to a path foo/bar/baz.txt can only invalidate build targets defined in that directory or any of its parents:  foo/bar/BUCK foo/BUCK BUCK  Symbolic links break this assumption; if foo/bar is actually a symbolic link to baz/blech, then we also have to invalidate the build targets defined in baz/blech/BUCK, and baz/BUCK.  This turns out to be pretty hard to implement correctly, so Buck's parser cache conservatively falls back and dumps a huge section of the cache whenever it sees a change to any files whose paths contain a symbolic link as a path component.  Even though we sternly warn when we do this, the net effect is that users complain that Buck is slow.  This
