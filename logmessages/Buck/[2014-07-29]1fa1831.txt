  Ensure project generation reserves GIDs specified in BUCK files.  Summary: Thanks to @coneko for pointing this out. In D1461424, I added the ability for generated projects to specify their GIDs.  However, I forgot that we need to generate GIDs for other targets, which theoretically could conflict with these hard-coded GIDs.  This adds a test and fixes the bug.  Test Plan: Wrote unit test, confirmed it failed. Applied patch, test passes.
