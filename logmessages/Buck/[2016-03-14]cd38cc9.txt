  Add autodeps=True to some rules under test/.  Summary:Added `autodeps = True` to the first 10 `BUCK` files (alphabetically) under `test/`:  ``` test/com/facebook/buck/android/BUCK test/com/facebook/buck/android/aapt/BUCK test/com/facebook/buck/android/agent/util/BUCK test/com/facebook/buck/apple/BUCK test/com/facebook/buck/apple/clang/BUCK test/com/facebook/buck/apple/simulator/BUCK test/com/facebook/buck/apple/xcode/BUCK test/com/facebook/buck/apple/xcode/xcspec/BUCK test/com/facebook/buck/artifact_cache/BUCK test/com/facebook/buck/autodeps/BUCK ```  As you can see, no `.java` files were changed, but a bunch of manual entries were made to `exported_deps`. I'm pretty sure that we should be able to autogenerate the `exported_deps` along with the `deps` as part of `buck autodeps`, which would likely make moving the rest of the build rules to `autodeps = True` almost trivial.  Given that there are still 81 more `BUCK` files to convert under `test/`, it is probably best to fix `buck autodeps` before proceeding with the rest of the migration.
