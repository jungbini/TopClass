  Include resource dependencies from other aars  Summary: Aars can depend on resources that are defined in another aar, most notably the google design library depending on resources defined in the appcompat library.  This can cause build errors or app crashes, if the resources are not included in the build.  Add tests to make sure we don't regress the recent fix for such aars.
