n/buck test test/... Built a d_binary with dir cache, removed the buck-out/gen and buck-out/bin directories, and ran the build again. Did the same for a d_test. Without this change, the buck-out/gen directory is not regenerated, so the binary we were supposed to build is missing. With the change, the binary is present. Ran buck build --show-output on a d_binary and saw that it prints the path to the binary now.  Reviewed By: andrewjcg  fb-gh-sync-id: 993a23a shipit-source-id: 993a23a
