  Fix Windows breakage in buck.py  Summary: Thanks to janicduplessis on Github for reporting this!  When I converted buck.py to speak BSER instead of JSON, I broke Windows compatibility.  The problem was that the Python `open` and `fdopen` APIs open the file in "text" mode by default, which translates `\r\n` to `\n` and vice-versa.  For binary files which don't use `\r\n` and `\n` to mean "end-of-line", you have to manually pass the `b` flag to `open` and `fdopen`.  This adds the flag to the appropriate calls in `buck.py`.
