  Propagate swift flavors instead of combining SwiftLibrary & SwiftCompile  Summary: This PR will fix the mistake I made in https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/831 and fix a problem with flavors propagation mentioned in https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/843. A few noticeable changes: 1. When platform flavor is not present, `SwiftLibraryDescription` will create a place holder (`SwiftLibrary`). 2. Create Swift companion target and add it in the extra deps list when necessary, this target will only be created in building target graph phrase.  ryu2 Please check if I have merge your changes correctly.
