This took about 1.5 seconds on every incremental compile.  Running `ant -d compile-bootstrapper`, I saw this curious output:  [javac] ClassLoaderBootstrapper.java added as ClassLoaderBootstrapper.class doesn't exist.

Unfortunately, this bypassed ant's built-in check to see if compiled `.class` files existed in the proper subdirectories, since it didn't grok the package layout.  To fix this, this
