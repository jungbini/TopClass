  Re-enable AppleTestIntegrationTest (except header symlink tree test)  Summary: This re-enables `AppleTestIntegrationTest`, which was disabled a while ago due to flakiness (since fixed) in CI.  I had to fix one test which was broken due to its `testdata` directory being renamed.  I left one test disabled (`AppleTestIntegrationTest.testAppleTestHeaderSymlinkTree()`) because I don't know how to get it to work. Hopefully k21 can get it working again.  Test Plan: `ant java-test -Dtest.class=AppleTestIntegrationTest`. Previously, tests didn't run. Now, they run and all pass except for `testAppleTestHeaderSymlinkTree()`.
