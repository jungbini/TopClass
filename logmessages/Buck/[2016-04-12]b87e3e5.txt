  Correctly set up SIGHUP on OS X  Summary:Currently, Ctrl+C terminates the daemon on OS X.  After a fair amount of debugging, I established that 1) this check is incorrect and 2) `NativeLibrary.findFunction` transitively searches dependencies because `getpid` is not defined in `libc.dylib` on OS X yet it still works.  Test Plan:Manual. Started a build, Ctrl+C, `ps aux | grep buckd` showed no process before this
