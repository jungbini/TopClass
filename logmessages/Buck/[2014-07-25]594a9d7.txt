  Ensure generated schemes correctly handle xcode_native targets.  Summary: This is a follow-up to use the new ProjectParser API added in D1459445 to fix the NPE Buck throws when generating schemes that include xcode_native targets.  Test Plan: Ran buck project --workspace-and-projects in fbobjc. Before, NPE. Now, it correctly generates the workspaces.  There are no tests yet for WorkspaceAndProjectGenerator; I filed a task to address this.
