  Fix AndroidBinaryIntegrationTest with python3 as default  Summary: On systems on which python refers to python3, the AndroidBinaryIntegrationTest fails in the testPreprocessorForcesReDex test, because of a python script that is not compatible with python3. PEP 0394 suggests that python2 should always refer to a valid python2 interpreter.  Adjust the shebang line to make the script use python2, which fixes the test.  Closes https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/389  Test plan: buck test  Test Plan: Imported from GitHub, without a `Test Plan:` line.
