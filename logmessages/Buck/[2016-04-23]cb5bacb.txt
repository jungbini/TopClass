  haskell: make empty archive link rule fix more robust  Summary: We use a `-optl` to have the haskell linker pass all the linker flags down into the system linker.  However, since the haskell linker needs at least one normal argument to run, we worked around this by generating a dummy empty library that it'd consume but which would eventually get thrown away at link time (as it wouldn't provide any used symbols).  The current strategy for doing this was to generate an empty file and wrap that in an archive.  However, some system linkers (e.g. ld.gold) require that archives contain valid native objects that generate a valid archive symbol table.  So, this
