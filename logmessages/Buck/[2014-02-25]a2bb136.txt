  Cleaned up all Eclipse warnings in src/ and test/ directories.  Summary: Here were the common errors: * Missing `@Overrides`. * Failure to add `<?>` to avoid a raw type error. * Malformed `{@link}` inline tags in Javadoc. * Missing `@SuppressWarnings("unused")`. * Using a `HashMap` with a static initializer instead of an `ImmutableMap`. * Switch statements that do not enumerate all enum values as cases.  @royw It would be nice if we could get checkstyle and/or PMD to help with these.  This also fixes https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/82.  Test Plan: No more yellow warning icons in Eclipse (Kepler).
