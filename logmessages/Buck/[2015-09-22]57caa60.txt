  JUnitStep: make junit tests runnable by an external test runner  Summary: This fixes some issues with junit tests so that they're runnable by an external test runner: - Build the classpath file outputside of the `JUnitStep` so that it's available when the command is run by an external test runner. - Make most of the postitional arguments to the junit runner options, so that the positional arguments are just the class files.  In particular, the output directory is now optional and the test will output to stdout if not set, allowing external test runners to choose how to parse the output (and to pick the output location). - Make the temporary directory optional, so that the runner will choose the standard temporary location if unset.  Test Plan: added integration test for java external test running
