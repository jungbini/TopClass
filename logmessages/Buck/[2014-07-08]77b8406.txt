  Easy: Change RuleKey logging to verbose level  Summary: Our logs are filled with tons of ultra-verbose RuleKey debug statements, even for rules we don't execute.  This changes RuleKey's logs to verbose level so we'll only see them if we explicitly enable them.  Depends On D1425020  Test Plan: buck build buck. Before, it spewed RuleKey logs to buck-out/log/buck-*.log. Now, it doesn't.
