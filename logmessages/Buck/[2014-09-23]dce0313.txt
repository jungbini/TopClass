  Make webserver's /trace handler resilient to files with timestamps in the name.  Summary: 9f5c2f6 introduced timestamps into build.trace filenames, which broke `TracesHelper.java`'s policy for finding the `.trace` file for a given trace id. This fixes the policy, but requires touching the filesystem.  Test Plan: Added `[httpserver]\nport=8082` to `.buckconfig.local` and verified that the links from `/traces` on the webserver work again.
