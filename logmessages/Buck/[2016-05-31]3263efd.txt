  fix ChromeTraceBuildListenerTest  Summary: testDeleteFiles was failing on windows because tracing uses memory mapped channels under the hood and test was written in such a way that channels were opened at the moment when Files.delete(traceFile) was called. There is a known java/windows issue about it - http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4715154.  The test was changed: instead of calling `deleteOldFiles` directly, now `outputTrace` is called - which in turn calls `deleteOldFiles`.  Test Plan: locally, CI (buck-verification-windows)  Reviewed By: Coneko  fbshipit-source-id: 902153a
