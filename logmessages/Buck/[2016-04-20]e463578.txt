  Fix Windows-only ClassUsageTracker bug  Summary:`ClassUsageTracker` was taking a shortcut and using a regex to parse the URI coming out of `javac`. The regex did bad things on Windows, where paths can start with things like `C:`.  The fix is to use methods on `URI` to deconstruct the URI.  Test Plan:It's really hard to test this on a Mac, so pushing to CI and letting it run Windows builds.  Reviewed By: Coneko  fb-gh-sync-id: 090b877 fbshipit-source-id: 090b877
