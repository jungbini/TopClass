  Fix a `FileAlreadyExistsException` on Unix Systems  Summary: One of the downsides to me developing Buck on Windows is that I don't actually create symlinks with Buck ever.  This hid a bug where I was not cleaning out my scratch directory for Rust code before generating a symlink tree (because copying a file to a place where one exists is perfectly fine).  Test Plan: Added a test that fails on Unix systems (but not Windows!)
