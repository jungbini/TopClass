  buck.py: speed up glob() by calling os.path.realpath() only on new symlinks  Summary: buck.py: speed up glob() by calling os.path.realpath() only on new symlinks  I ran this command on fbandroid:  python -m cProfile -s cumtime ../buck/src/com/facebook/buck/parser/buck_glob.py -i '**' .  and found out that most of the time was spent in `os.path.realpath()`.  This is easily fixed by tweaking the internal recursive function.  Test Plan: ``` python src/com/facebook/buck/parser/buck_test.py buck test --all  cd fbandroid; time python ../buck/src/com/facebook/buck/parser/buck_glob.py -i '**' . # The new function is now 1.2x faster than the original version of glob(). ```
