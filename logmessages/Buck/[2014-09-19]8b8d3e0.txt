  pathlib: Fix match() API and add more tests  Summary: When replacing our glob() implementation with pathlib, I ran into a nasty bug. The match() API (which applies a glob to a path and returns True or False) didn't work correctly when we passed in globs like:  a/**/*.java  I added tests to reproduce the bug and fixed it. I plan to contribute these fixes upstream as well.  Depends On D1567730  Test Plan: ant py-test
