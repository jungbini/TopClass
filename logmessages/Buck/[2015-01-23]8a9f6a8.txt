  Replace questionable logic in PathTypeCoercer  Summary: `PathTypeCoercerTest#coercingInvalidPathThrowsException` currently passes only because of a bug in `Path#normalize` (JDK-8037945) which causes `Paths.get("").normalize()` to throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Fix the logic to keep the tested behavior on versions of Java that are not affected by this bug.  Test Plan: * `buck test -f com.facebook.buck.rules.PathTypeCoercerTest` passes under both Java 7 and Java 8.
