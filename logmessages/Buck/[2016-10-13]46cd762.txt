  Add an escape hatch if `buck autodeps` misses things in Java 8.  Summary: This adds an optional `deps` argument to `standard_java_library()` where `deps` that cannot be found by `buck autodeps` can be added explicitly. This is analogous to specifying `generated_symbols` that come from annotation processors that cannot be automatically detected by Buck.  I'm unclear on whether `standard_java_test()` also needs this, in practice.  Test Plan: * Ran `ant clean default && ./bin/buck autodeps` and verified that no `BUCK.autodeps` files were changed. * CI  If someone can give me an example of something that `buck autodeps` cannot infer automatically because of new language features in Java 8, I'll be happy to verify that adding the missing build target to `deps` fixes things for now, though I would also like to plug the holes created by Java 8.
