  Fetch from all remotes when trying to get the required revision.  Summary: If the required revision is not in the local repository, Buck tries to get it by running `git fetch`.  However this only works if the revision is on the default remote, i.e. the one originally cloned from.  If the required revision is on another remote, i.e. a forked version, it will not be fetched.  Adding the `--all` option to `git fetch` fixes this.  Test Plan: 1. Clone buck from github. 2. Add another remote with `git remote add`. 3. In the test project set .buckversion to point to a revision that is only on the other remote. 4. Build the test project with `buck build`.
