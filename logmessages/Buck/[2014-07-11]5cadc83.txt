  Ensure ant test runs use Buck logging config  Summary: Thanks to @mbolin for pointing this out.  Although we always launch Buck via a launcher script that sets the system properties java.util.logging.class and buck.logging_config_file, the Ant task which launches JUnit tests currently doesn't.  That means it gets the default Java configuration for java.util.logging, which A) is ugly and B) has a setup which spews INFO logging to console by default.  This fixes the issue by setting java.util.logging.class and buck.logging_config_file in the Ant JUnit task.  Test Plan: ant java-test. Before, it spewed logs to console. Now, it writes them to buck-out/log.
