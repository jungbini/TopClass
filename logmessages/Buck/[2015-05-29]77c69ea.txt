  Sanitize framework search paths  Summary: * Use `DebugPathSanitizer` on framework search paths before adding them to the rule key of `CxxPreprocessAndCompileRule`. This will get rid of absolute framework search paths in the Apple rules' rule keys and will let us get hits in the shared cache independently on Xcode's installation directory.  Test Plan: * Set logging level to finer and check that the rule keys contain symbolic names instead of absolute paths.
