  Dirty fix for ProgressEstimator  Summary:Since the introduction of weighted executor in c5a044e37d each build rule can produce up to 3 suspended / resume events, but the `ProgressEstimator` is hardcoded to expect at most 2. This is not a future proof fix, but it should stop the issue with `ProgressEstimator` showing more than 100% finished.  Test Plan:`buck test` Run a build, check percentage does not go above 100%.
