  Upgrade PMD to 5.1.2  Summary: PMD 5.0.5 crashes with an NPE on this totally legit code:  private static final ThreadLocal<DecimalFormat> SIZE_UNIT_FORMAT = new ThreadLocal<DecimalFormat>() { @Override protected DecimalFormat initialValue() { DecimalFormat result = new DecimalFormat(); result.setMaximumFractionDigits(1); result.setRoundingMode(RoundingMode.DOWN); result.setGroupingUsed(false); return result; } };  Upgrading to PMD 5.1.2 resolves the issue. I ran into two things when upgrading it:  1) It spews false "unused private method" warnings all over the place (http://sourceforge.net/p/pmd/bugs/792/ among others)  2) It caught an import which was only used for a docblock comment  I fixed both of these issues.  Test Plan: ant pmd, previously crashed, now passes.
