  Fix bug in contents of metadata.txt file for secondary dexes.  Summary: I assume this was working without failure since fb4a would check if the same class was being loaded successfully by DexClassLoader.  Test Plan: `buck build fb4a` Manually inspect the metadata.txt file in the final APK and verify that the contents are correct. Also, verified that there were redundant class name entries in the APK without this fix.
