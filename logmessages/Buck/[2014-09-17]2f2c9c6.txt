  Include build uuid and timestamp in every cache artifact.  Summary: This will be useful to debug some of the caching issues, by helping figure out which buck run created an artifact.  Test Plan: In a sample project with cache mode set to dir, ``` $ buck build app $ buck clean $ buck build app $ cat buck-out/log/cache_artifact.txt (verify contents include the build id and time). $ buck clean $ buck build app $ cat buck-out/log/cache_artifact.txt (verify contents are the same). ```
