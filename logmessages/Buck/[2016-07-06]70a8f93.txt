  Rename .buckconfig to .buckconfig.local to exercise the intended behavior in an integration test.  Summary: As noted in the comment in `.buckconfig.local`, the behavior that was designed to be tested was being overwritten by `ProjectWorkspace`. This fixes it.  Test Plan: 1. CI 2. Stepped through `CachedTestIntegrationTest` in the debugger and verified that the correct values in `BuckConfig` were set and a `DirCacheEntry` was created with the correct value for `cacheDir`.
