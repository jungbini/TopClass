  Clean up old buck-*.log files when they go over 25 MiB in size  Summary: A user reported that their Buck log files were taking up tons of disk space.  I fixed the core issue in D1679619, but this adds insurance to make sure at startup that we clean up any old log files past 25 MiB worth of newer log files.  I didn't use the built-in java.util.logging support for log file size limits, since that simply rotates log files after a single log file gets to a particular size, which is not what we want.  Test Plan: Unit test included. Ran `buck project` in directory with lots of logs, confirmed old logs over 25 MiB were cleaned up and new log continued to exist.
