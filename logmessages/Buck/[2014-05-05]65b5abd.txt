  Make the ErrorListener for a BuckEventBus used in tests less chatty.  Summary: I changed the `ErrorListener` to check the level of the message that it prints so that it should actually only make noise when there is an error.  I believe that I originally introduced `ErrorListener` in https://phabricator.fb.com/D1067125 because, in the course of debugging a unit test, I was missing error messages from Buck that would have been helpful. This should preserve that property.  Test Plan: Ran `DescribedRuleTest` and nothing was printed to stderr. Previously, this would print "cheese" because it executed an `EchoStep`, which is implemented as:  ``` context.getBuckEventBus().post(LogEvent.info(message)); ```
