  Prefer Sha1HashCode.update(Hasher) to Hasher.putBytes(Sha1HashCode.getHash()).  Summary: `Sha1HashCode.update(Hasher)` is the preferred way of doing this because it is cheaper. `getHash()` should be reserved for debugging/unit tests.  This also replaces instances of `Sha1HashCode.toString()` with `Sha1HashCode.getHash()` so the use of the method is explicit and therefore easier to audit.  We could go so far as to move `getHash()` to a package-private test utility to help prevent this mistake, but that would make `Sha1HashCode.toString()` tricky to implement. (Also, there are some legitimate uses of `getHash()` in `src/`, so this really isn't feasible.)  D4074507 prompted this investigation.
