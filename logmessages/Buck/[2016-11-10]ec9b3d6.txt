  Fix AbstractExecutionContext.createSubContext() losing process executor  Summary: Currently, `AbstractExecutionContext.createSubContext()` is used to override the stdout/stderr streams when compiling Java code in `JavacStep`.  Unfortunately, today, that method discards the execution context's `ProcessExecutor` and overwrites it with a new `DefaultProcessExecutor` in order to override stdout and stderr.  I went to write a test for `JavacStep` and found that the `FakeProcessExecutor` I passed in was lost due to this issue.  To fix it, I introduce a new method `ProcessExecutor.cloneWithOutputStreams()` and implement it in `DefaultProcessExecutor` and `FakeProcessExecutor`.  Test Plan: Used in test in subsequent
