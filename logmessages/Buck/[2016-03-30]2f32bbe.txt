  Only clean dir cache on close if cache was written to  Summary:Previously this always cleans after every command. This is problematic for interactive commands like `--help`, as the command wouldn't exit and has to be ctrl-c'd.  This is a sorta-fix that only cleans the cache if the cache has stuff written to (and did not have a clean done).  Test Plan:1. Populate the dir cache with gigabytes of stuff. 2. `time buck --help` 3. See that it doesn't stick around after printing the usage string.
