  Easy: Improve logging in SuperConsole  Summary: While hacking on SuperConsole, I stupidly introduced an bug in the `render()` method which threw an `Error` exception.  Because `render()` is only called from a `ScheduledExecutorService`, the `Error` was silently swallowed. Worse yet, the `ScheduledExecutorService` silently stopped scheduling `render()`!  This at least adds a `LOG.error()` call to alert people of the exception rather than silently swallowing it.  Test Plan: CI  Reviewed By: sdwilsh  fb-gh-sync-id: 1df1b81
