  NOTESTS status for tests with no output  Summary: Buck's console output aggregates test results and summarizes them with a single word, which by default is "PASS".  I find that's really confusing as the test isn't really passing -- no test ran!  I find printing "NOTESTS" is more informative, especially for the cases where it's not obvious a test has been `@Ignore`'d.  (An alternative would be to not output any information for classes that don't have any tests in them, but that didn't feel right -- it's better to have a positive signal that nothing ran instead of absence-of-output to indicate nothing ran.  The latter just looks and feels like a bug.)  Test Plan: Run with an empty test class!
