  Rudimentary kotlin support.  Summary: Right now this change doesn't to much more than enable `kotlin_library()` and `kotlin_test()` build rules. You will still need to include the kotlin runtime as a separate prebuilt_jar() build rule or else your kotlin targets will crash and burn.  There isn't a `kotlin_binary()` target yet. Use `java_binary()` instead and remember to add the suffix 'Kt' when specifying the main class (see https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-to-kotlin-interop.html)  To use this you will need to:  - Have `kotlinc` in your path or specify it in your .buckconfig ```` [kotlin] compiler = ... ```` - Copy the kotlin-runtime.jar into your repo (intellij can do this for you when setting up kotlin) and create a `prebuilt_jar()` build rule for it. Include this target as a dependency under your `kotlin_library()` target. Closes https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/810  Reviewed By: Coneko  fbshipit-source-id: a47790d
