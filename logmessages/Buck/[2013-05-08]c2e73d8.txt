  Running an sh_test() was throwing an exception if it had been built but not executed.  Summary: Refactored some of the test rule code so that it must check whether its test results have been cached when considering whether the test needs to be run.  Ideally, TestRule would be an abstract class rather than an interface so that we could standardize some behavior across classes that implement TestRule.  Test Plan: Ran the following:  TESTS=`buck targets --type sh_test | xargs` buck clean buck build $TESTS buck test $TESTS  Previously, this failed in fbandroid because `buck test` would see that the rule was cached, so it assumed that the test results file was also written. This was an error that was fixed in java_test(), but not sh_test().
