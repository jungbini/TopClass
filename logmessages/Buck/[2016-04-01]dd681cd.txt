  Set HGPLAIN=1 when running Mercurial commands.  Summary:Specifying `$HGPLAIN` is something that we found to be critical on Nuclide where we shell out to `hg` for all sorts of things as part of the Hg integration. Without it, you have no idea what an `hg` subcommand can do because of local aliases the user may have defined.  Test Plan:`HgCmdLineInterfaceIntegrationTest#testTimestamp()` has been failing on my machine for months. I've been ignoring it, but I finally decided to investigate and this fixed it. I have quite a few aliases defined in my `~/.hgrc` file.  Reviewed By: marcinkosiba  fb-gh-sync-id: ae27af2 fbshipit-source-id: ae27af2
