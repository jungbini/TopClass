  Fix MultiArtifactCache bugs  Summary: There are several bugs in how the MultiArtifactCache works. 1. it assumes that all but the last cache is writable (on fetches). 2. it assumes that borrowing from a borrowable path happens synchronously  This fixes these issues. It makes store() and the fetch() promotion (where things fetched from one cache are stored to the prior ones) use the same function that properly handles BorrowablePath (by just disabling borrowing when there are multiple writable caches).
