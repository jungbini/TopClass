  Don't rewrite Xcode projects if nothing has changed.  Summary: Xcode tends to barf if its project files change from underneath it. Much of the time, we don't actually need to rewrite them, so this avoids touching any project files that haven't changed.  Test Plan: Unit tests included. Ran 'git clean -fxd' then 'buck project' twice in Xcode repo, confirmed in debug logs that it didn't rewrite the project files the second time.
