  Don't check ignored paths in DefaultFileHashCache (by default)  Summary: This check is taking up a considerable amount of time in no-op builds, and I've never heard of it catching an actual issue.  Let's disable it by default.  We can set a system property to re-enable it in CI to check for bugs.  Test Plan: Saw no-op builds being faster and more consistent.
