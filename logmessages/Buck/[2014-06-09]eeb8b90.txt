  JavaDirectoryStep: only reset compressed size for deflated entries  Summary: D984455 changed the ZipDirectoryStep to work around a rare bug which caused zip exceptions when re-compressing the entry changed the compressed size.  However, we should only do this for "deflated" zip entries, as "stored" zip entries require the compressed size to be equal to the uncompressed size (as documented at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/zip/ZipEntry.html#getCompressedSize()).  GitHub: fixes #132  Test Plan: Built a java binary dependening on a prebuilt JAR with an embedded JAR "stored" entry.
