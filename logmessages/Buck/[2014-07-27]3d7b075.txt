  Ensure values_file is built before android_build_config().  Summary: Fixed this bug by adding `values_file` to the `extraDeps` of the `BuildRuleParams`. I think this is an example of a bigger issue that @simons is looking at where `SourcePath`s are not automatically added as `extraDeps` to a `BuildRuleParams`.  Note that this also fixes the issue for `build_config_values_file` in `android_binary()` because `AndroidBinaryGraphEnhancer` delegates to `AndroidBuildConfigDescription.createBuildRule()`.  Test Plan: Built an `android_binary()` that had a transitive dependency on an `android_build_config()` with a `values_file` argument. Verified that the APK did not built without this change, but built with it.
