  [glob] Fix mistake in calling 'normpath_join'  Summary: [glob] Fix mistake in calling 'normpath_join'  I forgot to extract the last element of the path return by iglob(). This caused large 'stuttering' paths to be marked as seen, as reported by 'mread' on github: https://github.com/facebook/buck/issues/155  My take is that this bug had not consequence in production because in practice we link only files (not directories).  I tried to take a second look at performances but could not find any easy win. (If we want to maintain the same semantics w.r.t. symlinks, we need to call `islink` or something equivalent at least once per path.)  Test Plan: smokebuild  cd fbandroid; time python ../buck/src/com/facebook/buck/parser/buck_glob.py -i '**'  # about 3.3 sec instead of 3.2 before this
