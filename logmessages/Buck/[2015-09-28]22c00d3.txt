  Don't show warnings for superfluous R.txt entries in prebuilt aars  Summary: Some R.txt files in prebuilt aars contain entries which are not defined in the res directory, e.g. the R.txt in the google-play-services-base aar contains the entries for all other play-services aars, but doesn't define all of them in the res directory.  Because buck recently switched to using the resource entries from the R.txt from a prebuilt aar, instead of generating them from the res directory, this causes warnings such as: "Cannot find resource 'RDotTxtEntry{idType=int, type=attr, name=adSize, idValue=0x7f010000}' in the uber R.txt.".  The user cannot do anything about these warnings, short of editing the prebuilt aar, and they could be distracting from actual issues in the project.  Disable the warnings if the resources come from a prebuilt aar to fix this.  Closes https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/420  Test Plan: add test build project which includes the google-play-services-base
