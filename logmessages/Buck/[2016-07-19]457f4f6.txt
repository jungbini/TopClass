  Ensure all files returned from Watchman glob() exist  Summary: When enabling the Watchman-based replacement for `glob()`, we got occasional reports (usually after a source control operation) that `glob()` was returning files which didn't exist.  This appears to be a Watchman bug. Mercurial works around the issue via a sanity check that all files returned by Watchman actually exist on disk, so this adds a new `.buckconfig` setting to do the same in Buck (enabled by default):  [parser] watchman_glob_sanity_check = stat  Because this is a performance hit, this can be disabled via:  [parser] watchman_glob_sanity_check = none  Test Plan: Enabled watchman globbing in .buckconfig:  [parser] glob_handler = watchman  Ran `buck project` in complex repo, confirmed in buck-out/log/buck-0.log that Watchman globbing was enabled and that sanity check was enabled.  Repeated with sanity check disabled:  [parser] glob_handler = watchman watchman_glob_sanity_check = none  Also ran `buck test //src/com/facebook/buck/json:buck_test`  Reviewed By: yiding  fbshipit-source-id: c99a582
