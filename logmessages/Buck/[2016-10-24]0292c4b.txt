  Remove an unnecessary check for LinearAlloc in debug builds  Summary: This check was added in the early days of pre-dexing on the assumption that it would be a very rare error.  However, in a world where gradle users are converting large apps to Buck, it's been happening more often and causing unnecessary pain.  I think we can drop this because: - Most of our developers do not target Gingerbread. - Those that do don't necessarily need their *debug* builds to work on Gingerbread (this check doesn't apply to release builds). - Our ability to accurately predict LinearAlloc exhaustion on this codepath is actually quite weak.  Test Plan: Gautam from Uber has been trying this locally with success.  Reviewed By: asp2insp  fbshipit-source-id: 51a3daa
