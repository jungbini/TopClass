  D: cache object files from compile build rules  Summary:Previously, caching was broken due to absolute paths in the target name, so it never exposed the fact that D compile rules didn't record their outputs to the cache recorder, which meant cache hits didn't actually pull down the object file.  This fixes that, and also threads through the source "name" into the compile rule so that archives get useful names in them, rather than multiple identical entries names after the rule short name.
