  Make EdenProjectFilesystemDelegate.computeSha1() retry symlinks appropriately.  Summary: The Thrift API for Eden fails if the path passed to `getSHA1()` is a symlink. This adds logic to Buck to try to recover from this in a graceful way.  This upgrades us from jimfs-1.0 to jimfs-1.1 to pick up this fix: https://github.com/google/jimfs/issues/18  Test Plan: Introduced a new unit test: `EdenProjectFilesystemDelegateTest`. Incidentally, this is our first use of PowerMock in Buck.  Reviewed By: yiding  fbshipit-source-id: a472b95
