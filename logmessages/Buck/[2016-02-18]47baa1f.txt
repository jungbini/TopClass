  Always ignore the trash dir  Summary:We do not always ignore buck-out like the comment in the code says. Unfortunately, tracking that down doesn't look trivial, so I'm papering over the issue I'm about to describe by ignoring the `.trash` directory for now and adding a TODO.  When we noticed a changed in the `buckversion`, we move the contents of `buck-out` into `buck-out/.trash` and then start to asynchronously delete it.  However, we also start walking the filesystem early on in order to find build files.  Since `buck-out` isn't actually ignored, we end up walking it.  On Windows at least, we end up getting a security exception because we are trying to walk a file that was asynchronously removed.  Test Plan:It's hard to prove that something that happens intermittently is actually fixed, but I'm not seeing it anymore.  Reviewed By: Coneko  fb-gh-sync-id: c2a9b1d shipit-source-id: c2a9b1d
