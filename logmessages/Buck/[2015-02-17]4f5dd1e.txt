  Copy exported deps from AppleBuildRules  Summary: If we had the situation:  foo.framework [depends on] barDylib.framework [depends on and exports] bazDylib.framework  then when asking `AppleBuildRules` which dependencies of `foo.framework` to copy, we were only copying `barDylib.framework`, not `bazDylib.framework`.  This fixes the bug and adds a test.  Test Plan: Added new test. Before fix, ran:  ant java-test -Dtest.class=AppleBuildRulesTests  Confirmed test failed. Applied fix, re-ran command, test passed.
