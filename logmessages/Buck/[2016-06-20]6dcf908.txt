  Resolver to support JSON configuration and user-pass authentication  Summary: Ref #664  Modifies `Resolver` to support:  * basic authentication * multiple Maven repositories at the same time * reading repository, Maven, and artifact settings from a file * optionally overridding these from the command line.  The PR a bit wobbly, as some of the `Resolver` code is now only used in the integration tests. Will fix, but wanted to make sure this is something you guys are ok having merged :D Closes https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/691  Test Plan: Haven't touched the unit tests yet, but tried it out on some artifacts I needed to download.
