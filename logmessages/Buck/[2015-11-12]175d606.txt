  Hook up android_instrumentation_test to test infrastructure  Summary: When android_instrumentation_test was introduced, an integration test was added, but I forgot to hook it up to the test infrastructure.  This caused us to miss that some binary files broke when importing the pull request from GitHub.  Hook up the integration test to the test infrastructure and fix the broken binary files. Closes https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/507  Test Plan:  buck test with and without android devices attached
