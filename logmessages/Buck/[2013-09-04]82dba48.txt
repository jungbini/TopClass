  Fix some build cache interaction issues in AndroidResourceRule.  Summary: (1) `AndroidResourceRule` was writing its output to `buck-out/bin` instead of `buck-out/gen`. This was causing the following check in `AbstractCachingBuildRule` to fail:  ``` if (pathToOutputFile != null && pathToOutputFile.startsWith(BuckConstant.GEN_DIR)) { String prefix = BuckConstant.GEN_DIR + '/' + getBuildTarget().getBasePathWithSlash(); buildInfoRecorder.recordArtifact(pathToOutputFile.substring(prefix.length())); } ```  After fixing this for `AndroidResourceRule`, I manually inspected the `getPathToOutputFile()` method in all build rules, and verified that if a non-null value was returned, it started with `buck-out/gen`.  (2) `AndroidResourceRule` had two fields that were not being included in its RuleKey.  Test Plan: Sandcastle builds.
