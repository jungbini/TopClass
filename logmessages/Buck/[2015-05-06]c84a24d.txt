  Upgrade Immutables.org to 2.0.11-SNAPSHOT to fix IntelliJ build  Summary: This upgrades Immutables.org to upstream rev 6edec0106f571916f9221c3dc3ab657dd317c87f (2.0.11-SNAPSHOT) to fix the IntelliJ build.  There are still issues with the Eclipse build, but this will improve life for the Buck developers who use IntellIJ (they no longer have to run `ant ide` to prepare the build).  Test Plan: Built in IntellJ 14. Confirmed immutable classes were created in `build-ij/immutables` and that completion worked in the UI.
