  CachingBuildEngine: fix event ordering  Summary:Previuosly, the build engine would nest build event scopes inside of each other via setting up callbacks.  This worked most of the time, but there was no guarantee that one of the inner futures/callables would start before the outer one finished.  Test Plan:Ran the caching build engine tests in a tight loops for 10s of minutes.  Previously, this easily repro'd ordering issues, but didn't with this fix.
