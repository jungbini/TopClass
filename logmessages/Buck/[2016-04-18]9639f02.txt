  Support the legacy @ syntax and no cell prefix  Summary:Support both '@' and no cell prefixes at all.  This is an intermediate step (or could just hang around...).  It tries pretty hard to handle both 'cell//' and 'cell//' and tries to prevent you from registering both 'cell' and 'cell' to prevent confusion.  Test Plan: unit tests.  Need to add one more.
