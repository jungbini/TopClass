  Fix linking for iOS Simulator  Summary: We were unable to link binaries when targeting the iOS simulator, because I incorrectly assumed based on the documentation that both iOS and iOS Simulator were targeted with the linker flag `-mios-version-min=...`.  In fact, when linking binaries for iOS simulator, you have to specifically pass the undocumented flag `-mios-simulator-version-min=...` or the linker warns:  ld: warning: ObjC object file (buck-out/bin/path/to/lib#compile-pic-src_Foo_Bar.m.o,iphonesimulator-x86_64/src/Foo/Bar.m.o) was compiled for iOS Simulator, but linking for MacOSX  This fixes the warning and adds a test.  While I was at it, I discovered we were setting the C++ linker flags but not the C linker flags.  Test Plan: Unit test updated. `ant java-test -Dtest.class=AppleCxxPlatformsTest`
