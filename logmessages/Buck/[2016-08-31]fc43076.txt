  Use bser to communicate between Buck and buck.py  Summary: To handle cross-cell, we no longer have a single watch root and project prefix. This means we will need to communicate more than a single line at a time. Switch to bser to communicate from buck to buck.py (we already use it to communicate from buck.py back to buck).  Test Plan: Ensure tests still pass.  Reviewed By: bhamiltoncx  fbshipit-source-id: 154a788
