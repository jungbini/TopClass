  Parser: fix caching bug when package boundary checks are disabled  Summary: When package boundary checks are disabled, it's possible for ancestor build files to references the same source files as their descedants. Therefore, we need to invalidate these build paths if new files are added via glob, so that they don't go stale.  (In theory, without package boundary checks, it's possible for rules to reference *any* source file in the repo, which means we should technically invalidate *everything*.  We should probably make preventing ".." independent of boundary checks, or work quickly to remove the option to disable them.)  Test Plan: added unittest
