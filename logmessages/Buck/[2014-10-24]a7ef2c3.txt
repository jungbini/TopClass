  Fix assertion error about mixed relative and absolute paths  Summary: Running `buck project --combined-project TARGET` was failing with `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Both paths must be absolute or both paths must be relative.` This patch fixes the error by replacing the offending call to `MorePaths.relativize` with a call to `PathRelativizer.outputDirToRootRelative`.  Test Plan: `buck project --combined-project TARGET`
