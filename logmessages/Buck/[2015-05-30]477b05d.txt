  Don't recursively copy or link dependencies of genrules in Apple project generation  Summary: Previously, `AppleBuildRules.getRecursiveTargetNodeDependenciesOfType()` would go through all recursive dependencies of a rule (stopping at bundles) when determining what to link or copy into a rule.  This meant even dependencies of `genrule` executed as part of a build were being linked or copied into rules that depended on the genrule.
