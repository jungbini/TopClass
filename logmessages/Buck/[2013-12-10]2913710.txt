  Remove list of java files from javac command-line; use `@classes` instead.  Summary: Replace [potentially long] list of .java files in javac command-line debug output by file with `@classes` param.  Test Plan: Tested on one of the android projects 1) Take any buck java project 2) Insert something in source code so that it won't compile 3) run 'buck build <project-name>' 4) it should output error log 5) the last line of this log should be javac command with all the arguments but without list of java files to compile. Instead it should end with `@buck-out/java_files_to_compile`.  Also unit tests in JavacInMemoryStepIntegrationTest and JavacInMemoryStepIntegrationTest.
