  Do not fail during shutdown processing.  Summary: Currently if a timeout occurs during shutdown a non-zero value is returned by Buck, which can cause integration tests to erroneously fail. This change restores the original behaviour which was to return 0 if an exception is thrown during shutdown processing while also continuing to report shutdown exceptions on the console to aid debugging.  Test Plan: 0) Disconnect from the network. 1) `buck test --all`
