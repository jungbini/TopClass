  Add exported deps to fix build for Java 8.  Summary:Apparently Java 7 was able to compile some things with less information than Java 8. Added some more `exported_deps` to make sure that everything makes it to the classpath in the presence of `buck autodeps`.  Test Plan:* Switched from Java 7 to Java 8: `/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8` * Ran `git clean -xfd`. * Ran `./scripts/travisci_run.sh` * Verified that compilation failed as it did on Travis before this change and worked after this change  Reviewed By: sdwilsh  fb-gh-sync-id: 57b9722 shipit-source-id: 57b9722
