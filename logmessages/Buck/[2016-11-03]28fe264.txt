  The assumption behind this commit was that we were mixing `{0}` and `printf` style formatting and failing to format the latter.  This wasn't actually true, and this change introduced a bug where any message containing a `%` post-format started raising errors.  I will follow this up with a test to confirm the desired behavior.
