  Handle statically linked libs in dynamic link trees correctly  Summary: We added support for C/C++ libs tagged with `force_static` to always be statically linked even when performing a dynamic link down the dep tree.  However, due to how we walk the dep tree, this caused the force-static lib to get statically linked into all transitive dependents, rather than just first-order dependents.  This
