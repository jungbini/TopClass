  Time out and disable Watchman after 10 seconds  Summary: Previously, we would wait 10 minutes for `watchman` commands to return.  We would print nothing to the console while waiting, which made for a very frustrating experience for users in very large repositories (which could take a few minutes to scan).  This change builds on my new class `ListeningProcessExecutor` to allow us to check on the status of `watchman` commands and let the user know what's going on.  After 1 second of waiting, we will now tell the user:  Waiting for Watchman command [watchman watch-project /path/to/project]...  After 10 seconds of waiting, we will give up and let the user know we've disabled Watchman:  Watchman did not respond within 10000 ms, disabling.  When I did this, I found the logic in `Main.java` did not actually handle `Watchman.build()` returning `Watchman.NULL_WATCHMAN`, so I fixed that. Now, we cleanly disable daemonized behavior if Watchman cannot be reached.  Test Plan: Unit tests updated. `ant java-test -Dtest.class=WatchmanTest` Ran `kill -STOP [watchman-pid]; buck build buck`. Confirmed UI appeared as above and build continued.
