  C/C++: fix unreferenced root handling in omnibus link  Summary: Previously, we added the prebuilt DSOs for omnibus root nodes to the omnibus link, so that any undefined symbols in the root nodes were seen by the linker and caused the appropriate definitions to get included in the omnibus merged shared library.  However, this also caused runtime references to the root shared library names to also get added to the omnibus binary.  Since roots don't necessarily need to be loadable by their shared libary names (e.g. python C/C++ extensions shouldn't get loaded by native code -- only from the interpreter, in a language-specific way), we can't reliably embed references to them in the omnibus library.
