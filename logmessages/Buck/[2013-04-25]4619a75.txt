  Adding --force when pushing to gh-pages seems to fix things.  Summary: Previously, publish.sh was failing with complaints of:  ! [rejected]        HEAD -> gh-pages (non-fast-forward) error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:facebook/buck.git' To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the 'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.  Presumably this is because I am doing some funny stuff with `--orphan`. Using `--force` appears to fix things.  Test Plan: Manually tried this and it worked.
