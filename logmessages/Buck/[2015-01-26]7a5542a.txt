  Fix FakeProjectFilesystem.getFilesUnderPath()  Summary: `FakeProjectFilesystem.getFilesUnderPath()` is broken in a bunch of ways currently. It had no tests, so it sadly regressed.  1) `ProjectFilesystem.walkRelativeFileTree()` is polymorphic, but the most general version of the API which takes an `EnumSet<FileVisitOption>` was private, so `FakeProjectFilesystem` could not override it.  2) `ProjectFilesystem.getFilesUnderPath()` incorrectly converted the project-relative path to an absolute path before passing it to `ProjectFilesystem.walkRelativeFileTree()`. That method requires a project-relative path.  3) `FakeProjectFilesystem.getFilesUnderPath()` was implemented to always return the empty set.  Test Plan: New test added. Confirmed it failed until I fixed all above issues.
