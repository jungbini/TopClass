  Update DefaultJavaLibraryRule so it implements AbiRule.  Summary: When a DefaultJavaLibraryRule is built, it writes its RuleKey and ABI-key-without-deps to disk. This makes it straightforward to extend DefaultJavaLibraryRule so that it implements AbiRule.  Methods of AbiRule that require reading a file from disk are now passed a ProjectFilesystem.  This also fixes an issue in AbstractCachingBuildRule where a RuleKey was not written when a recompile was avoided due to unchanged ABI keys.  This fixes a bug in ProjectFilesystem, as well as introduces some new methods. Unit tests are added, as appropriate.  Test Plan: Added a new test to DefaultJavaLibraryRuleIntegrationTest to verify that ABIs get written and that they are used successfully to avoid unnecessary recompilation. Sandcastle builds.
