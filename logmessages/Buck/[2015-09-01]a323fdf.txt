  Fix deadlock in buckd shutdown  Summary: This integrates my fix for a deadlock when shutting down buckd:  https://github.com/martylamb/nailgun/pull/73  This was the deadlock:  Thread 1 -> NGUnixDomainServerSocket.accept() -> lock this -> check isBound and isClosed -> NGUnixDomainSocketLibrary.accept(fd) -> (blocks indefinitely in accept with lock held) Thread 2 -> NGUnixDomainServerSocket.close() -> try to lock this (which is locked by Thread 1) -> deadlock  The fix was pretty simple and is described in the pull request above.  Test Plan: Reproduced deadlock with `./bin/buck version; ./bin/buckd`. Added logging to confirm situation above. Applied fix, repeated steps, no more deadlock.
