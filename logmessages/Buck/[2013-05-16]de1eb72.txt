  Fix 'buck project' for annotation processing  Summary: D766822 includes an AndroidLibraryRule.Builder that has its own AnnotationProcessingParams.Builder rather than using the inherited one from JavaLibraryRule.Builder.  This breaks 'buck project's ability to generate IntelliJ files that work with annotation processing.  This change fixes that and adds a unit test to verify that this does not break in the future.  Test Plan: - unit tests - 'buck project' in fb4a and verify module_...iml references annotation sources.
