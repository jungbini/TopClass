  Enable 'buck project --profile' to profile buck.py performance  Summary: We've gotten some complaints that buck.py performance is unacceptable. This adds a new option to `buck project`, `--profile`, which enables Python profiling.

When I enable this, I see that glob() is a top user of CPU time, so tackling that first will give us lots of improvements.  Test Plan: `buck project --profile`, confirmed output in logs
