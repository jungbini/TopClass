  Easy: Ensure GeneratedSignedSourceTarget GID doesn't bounce around  Summary: In D1231081, I added support for a target name -> GID map to re-use existing GIDs if possible (to keep external Xcode workspace scheme references working).  However, I forgot to use the map for the special GeneratedSignedSourceTarget target!  That wouldn't have been too big a deal, except @yiding asked me to build a set of "reserved" GIDs and ensure the GID generator never used them. Because of this, the GeneratedSignedSourceTarget target GID would bounce up and down by 1 every time we generated the project.  Now, we'll re-use the previous GeneratedSignedSourceTarget GID if present.  Test Plan: Added unit test to reproduce bug:  https://phabricator.fb.com/P8066056  Applied fix, unit test now passes.
