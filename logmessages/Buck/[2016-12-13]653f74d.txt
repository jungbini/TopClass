  Fix ObjectPathsAbsolutifierIntegrationTest  Summary: The test passed input and output paths that are equivalent to each other which was not caught because of a wrong precondition check. The precondition check is fixed in https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/1043, but that PR cannot land until the test is fixed.  Test Plan: CI.  Reviewed By: Coneko  fbshipit-source-id: 2ac82af
