  Use EdenProjectFilesystemDelegate when root is subdirectory of Eden mount.  Summary: We may have cases where an Eden mount contains a `.buckconfig` file that is not in its root. When this happens, when `EdenProjectFilesystemDelegate` makes calls to Eden's Thrift API, it must prefix relative Buck project paths so that they are relative to the root of the Eden mount.  For good measure, I also updated the Eden Thrift JARs.  Test Plan: * Updated unit tests. * Manually tested using Buck in an Eden mount with a `.buckconfig` in a subdirctory. * `ant java-test -Dtest.class=EdenMountTest` and `ant java-test -Dtest.class=EdenClientTest`  Reviewed By: marcinkosiba  fbshipit-source-id: 23e2190
