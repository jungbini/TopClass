  Upgrade xctool to 296eb9e5a184cb692d8f7d8f1d59ffbbeea104a8  Summary: I sent @ExtremeMan a proper pull request for my Buck changes to `xctool`:  https://github.com/facebook/xctool/pull/517  The pull request adds lots of tests plus a few changes he requested (like passing `-logicTest` and `-appTest` at the end of the command line), along with a few bonus fixes:  1) `xctool` now launches the iOS Simulator app in the background, so it doesn't steal focus  2) `xctool` now automatically figures out the architecture and simulator from the test bundle binary, so we don't need to pass the flags `-destination arch=foo,name=bar` any more  Test Plan: ant java-test -Dtest.class=XctoolRunTestsStepTest ant java-test -Dtest.class=AppleTestIntegrationTest
