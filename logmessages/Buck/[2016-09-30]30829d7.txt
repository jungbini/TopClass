  Remove transitive entries from immediate classpath  Summary: Running benchmarks on large-scale repositories revealed that we spend a lot of time in `getTransitiveClasspaths` and in particular that there is a recursive call ``` getTransitiveClasspaths -> getImmediateClasspaths -> getTransitiveClasspaths -> ... ``` This does not seem correct, if I understand the model correctly, immediate classpaths should not include transitive classpaths of the library's exported dependencies. Replace `getTransitiveClasspaths` call with `getImmediateClasspaths` to fix this and improve performance.  Test Plan: `buck test`  Reviewed By: marcinkosiba  fbshipit-source-id: 256588c
