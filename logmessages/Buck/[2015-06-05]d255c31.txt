  Print stack traces of tests that have timed out  Summary: If a junit (or robolectric) test has timed out, print a stack trace of what it is doing to help the owner debug it.  Test Plan: Modified `test.rule_timeout` in `.buckconfig.local`, and added this snippet to a test:  ```    try { Thread.sleep((long) 50000000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }```  I then ran that test with Buck, and saw the stack trace printed out.
