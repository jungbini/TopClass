  Upgrade Immutables.org to 2.0.11 final (hopefully) fix Eclipse build  Summary: This upgrades Immutables.org to upstream rev d2bf5b105fa45eb5a074adf9f4f49337ea3b7bb6 (2.0.11 final) to (hopefully) fix the Eclipse build.  I don't have Eclipse set up myself, so I hope @bolinfest can try it out.  If this works, I'll remove the `ant ide` target in the next build.  Test Plan: `ant java-test -Dtest.class=TypeTest`
