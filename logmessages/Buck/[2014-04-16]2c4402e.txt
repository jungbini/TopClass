  Expose hashes of .class files that end up in a DexWithClasses.  Summary: PreDexedFilesSorter uses this to create a map of dex input paths to their hash, just like HashInputJarsToDexStep. Everything will slowly come together perfectly :)  Test Plan: build messenger. Add a call to `getDexInputsHashes()` before returning PreDexedFilesSorter.Result, attach debugger and verify hashes are getting calculated.
