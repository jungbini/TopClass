  Fix rulekey of `AndroidResourceRule`.  Summary: Rulekey for a build rule should incorporate both the input file names and their contents. Right now, `AndroidResourceRule.appendToRuleKey()` adds the input file contents and not their file names to the rule key. As a result, we do not rebuild an android_resource rule if name/path of the inputs change. For instance, renaming a layout file results in a compilation error (cannot find the new `R.layout.<>` symbol) since we do not rebuild the `R.java` file.  Rulekey now includes the input file paths along with their contents. File contents are already hashed by correctly implementing `getInputsToCompareToOutput()`.  Test Plan: `buck build instagram` Rename `android_res/com/instagram/android/res/layout/spinner_gender_dropdown.xml` to `android_res/com/instagram/android/res/layout/spinner_gender_dropdown_test.xml`. Patch `java/com/instagram/android/fragment/EditProfileFragment.java` with the new id. `buck build instagram`  Added a unit test which fails without the fix.
