  Easy: Make TestResults an immutable value type  Summary: I plan on adding optional debug logs to `TestResults`. This makes the object an `Immutable` value type so we can more easily add optional fields to it without changing dozens of callsites.  I found there were a few places like `TestResultsGrouper` which relied on mutating `TestResults` which already exists. I updated them to use immutable copies with changed fields instead.
