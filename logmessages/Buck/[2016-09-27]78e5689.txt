  Return error instead of crashing for values which cannot be encoded in BSER  Summary: Previously, if someone tried to insert a value which could not be encoded in BSER, `buck.py` would just crash, and the user would see an unhelpful message like:  BUILD FAILED: Couldn't get dependency '//foo:bar' of target '//baz:blech': Parse error for build file /path/to/foo/BUCK: Parser exited unexpectedly  Since any `BUCK` file could add any arbitrary value to a field (say, `object()`), we need to cleanly handle this and return a fatal diagnostic instead of crashing.  Test Plan: Unit test added. Before fix, ran test with: buck test //src/com/facebook/buck/json:buck_test Confirmed test failed. Applied fix, re-ran test, confirmed test passed.
