  WatchmanWatcher: Fix ignores for *.pbxproj globs  Summary: I noticed in the logs that we were passing to watchman filename globs like `*.pbxproj` with the `wholename` flag set:  [com.facebook.buck.util.WatchmanWatcher] Writing query to Watchman: [...,{"expression":["not",["match","*.pbxproj","wholename"],...}]  When `wholename` is set, watchman requires the entire path to match. Any `/` characters in the path must be explicitly matched in the pattern (either literally or with `**/*.pbxproj`).  Since we don't really care about the directory, this simply removes the `wholename` flag from the match expression so it matches just the filename.  I also fixed a comment which incorrectly suggested these globs were present in project.ignoreGlobs; they're actually internal-only and hard-coded to a fixed value.  Test Plan: Unit tests updated. `ant java-test -Dtest.class=WatchmanWatcherTest`.  Ran `buck build buck`, confirmed query was passed correctly to Watchman.
