  Remove testdata ignore from watchmanconfig  Summary: Previously, `.watchmanconfig` ignored any files in various `testdata` directories (I assume to improve performance of scanning the Buck repository).  We plan on using Watchman to improve perf of `glob()` calls in the `BUCK` file parser, so ignoring these directories means we would fail to include various resources pulled in via `glob()`.  This removes the `testdata` directories from Buck's `.watchmanconfig`.  Note that you have to restart Watchman in order for these to take effect (yes, Watchman doesn't reload its config when it watches changes to its config file. Who watches the.. never mind.)  Test Plan: Changed default glob to Watchman, ran tests, saw that `AppleInfoPlistParsingTest` failed. Applied fix, confirmed tests no longer failed.
