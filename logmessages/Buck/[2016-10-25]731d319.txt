  Fix consistent build error with ant  Summary: I got following build error consistently when rebuilding `buck` with `ant` after switching between branches. This can be fixed easily, and could save us development times.  ``` compile: [javac] Compiling 685 source files to buck/build/classes [javac] [total compilation time: 1070] [javac] ---------- [javac] 1. ERROR in /Users/thonguyen/Desktop/uber-buck/src/com/facebook/buck/rules/coercer/ListTypeCoercer.java (at line 26) [javac] 	public class ListTypeCoercer<T> extends CollectionTypeCoercer<ImmutableList<T>, T> { [javac] 	                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [javac] Inconsistent classfile encountered: The undefined type parameter C.Builder is referenced from within CollectionTypeCoercer<C,T> [javac] ---------- [javac] 1 problem (1 error)  BUILD FAILED ... ``` Closes https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/965  Reviewed By: Coneko  fbshipit-source-id: 6577a77
