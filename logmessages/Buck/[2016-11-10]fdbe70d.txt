I'l leave them as a comment to the source.  There a bunch of things I would love to do in follow-up patches: - Make this test configuration debuggable - "Jump to source" in test tree view. - Create test configurations from context (right click on test classes/methods) - Install configuration (with debug)  So please let me know if fb will be ready to consider accept them.  $ third-party/java/intellij/get_jars.sh ...
