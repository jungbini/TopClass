  Create a step to hash inputs to be passed to the smart dexing step.  Summary: This is pretty much what `SmartDexingStep.DxPseudoRule.hashInputs()` does. The idea is that SmartDexingStep will these hashes injected into it.  Test Plan: Added this new step in `AndroidBinary.addDexingSteps()`, build instagram/messenger with pre dex off. Using debugger, verified hashes were getting created correctly.
