  Easy: Fix Turkish 'I' bug in AdbHelper  Summary: `ant forbidden-checks` found this one!  `AdbHelper.deviceUninstallPackage()` is a wrapper for the Android utility `pm uninstall`.  It tried to do a case-insensitive match on the string `failure` on the output of the utility by calling `String.toLowerCase()`.  Unfortunately, the output of that method is locale-specific and depends on the default locale of the system.  In particular, in Turkish, the string "FAILURE" will lower-case to the string "", and the check will not pass.  This fixes the logic by passing in `Locale.US` to ensure we don't use the default locale.  Test Plan: `ant forbidden-checks` no longer finds this error  Reviewed By: ryu2  fb-gh-sync-id: 7ff3837
