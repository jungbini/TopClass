  Migrate test/ to use autodeps.  Summary:At first, I started this revision by finding `java_test()` and `java_library()` rules under the `test/` folder and removing the `deps` and `exported_deps` arguments and replacing them with `autodeps = True`. However, the majority of the `BUCK` files under `test/` follow the following pattern:  ``` java_library( name = 'testutil', srcs = glob(['*.java'], excludes = ['*Test.java']), autodeps = True, visibility = [ '//test/...', ], )  java_test( name = <NAME_OF_DIRECTORY>, srcs = glob(['*Test.java']), resources = glob(['testdata/**'], include_dotfiles=True), autodeps = True, ) ```  So to eliminate this boilerplate, I introduced a macro:  standard_java_test(run_test_separately = False)  that generates the above rules for the `srcs` in the directory. Of the 90 `BUCK` files in the `test/` directory, 61 of them (or 68%) could be reduced to a single call to `standard_java_test()`. I suspect that if we put in the effort, we could get that number to 90%. This will reduce a bunch of boilerplate in creating `BUCK` files for tests.  For example, here are two files that should be able to use the macro, but cannot due to small bugs:  ``` test/com/facebook/buck/maven/BUCK test/com/facebook/buck/testutil/integration/BUCK ```  To find other files that are candidates for using the macro, run:  ``` find test -name BUCK | xargs grep -l -e '^java_test' | wc -l ```  Finally, note this revision added a `BUCK` file, as it was missing:  test/com/facebook/buck/cxx/elf/BUCK  Apparently `ElfTest.java` was not being run.
