  Sanitize Apple SDK, platform and developer directories  Summary: * Use a custom `DebugPathSanitizer` for Apple rules that will sanitize Apple SDK, platform and developer directories. * This will be necessary to stop absolute paths from being included in the rule key.  Test Plan: * Run a build with a `FINER` logging level, check that the rule keys contain the symbolic names instead of the absolute paths in the flags.
