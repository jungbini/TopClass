  Fix how android resource dependencies are added to `UberRDotJava`.  Summary: Apparently, you need to set the dependencies _before_ `Builder.newBuildable()` gets called.  I plan to add an assertion in the Builder superclass so that trying to add a dep in `newBuildable()` throws an exception.  Test Plan: Ran this command before and after the fix.  `buck build --verbose 10 automation_fbandroid_froyo_mdpi_debug 2>&1 | grep uber_r`  Verified deps are included in the rule key with this change.
