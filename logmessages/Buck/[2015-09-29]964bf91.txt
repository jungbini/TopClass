  Start server with daemon start, not only when you need to parse stuff.  Summary: I've noticed a bug that when you `buck server status --http-port` on clean start (after buck kill/killall java), it does not print port. (It prints -1). Apparently, we don't start web server. We only start it for parsing.  Test Plan: `buck server status --http-port` on clean start (after buck kill/killall java) and make sure server port is not -1.  `NO_BUCKD=1 buck server status --http-port` still returns -1
