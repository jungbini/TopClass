  buck query: don't resolve transitive deps in filter-based functions  Summary:Filter-based functions (e.g. `filter`, `kind`) are supposed to operate on the immediate input nodes, but the base class was resolving transitive deps, which made it really slow.  As far as I can tell, this was a copy/paste bug, as this is used in all other function base classes where transitive deps are actually needed.  Test Plan:Compared `buck query <targets>` and `buck query 'kind(<kind>, <targets>)'`. Before this change, the latter was significantly slower.  Now they're about the same speed.
