  cxx: stop using `HasPostBuildSteps` for symlink tree rules  Summary: The `HasPostBuildSteps` was originally added as a way for rules to generate some output that wouldn't be cached.  However, there are some bugs in it's implementation around failure atomicity which can cause interrupted builds to get stuck in a broken state.  Since we now support selectively disabling build rules, just have symlink tree rules use that (as this is the original intent).  Test Plan: CI  Reviewed By: yiding  fbshipit-source-id: 45c4b24
