  C/C++: normalize paths before checking depfiles for used headers  Summary:Currently, dep-file rule keys work by using gcc-generated depfiles to determine the subset of headers that a rule actually uses.  We implement this by using the intersection of headers in the depfile and the set of all headers from all transitive deps.  However, if the user uses `..` references in includes, the depfile header paths will also include these, and they won't match how Buck represents the headers internally.  This
