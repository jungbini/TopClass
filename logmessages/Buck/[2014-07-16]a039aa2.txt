  Use MorePaths.relativize() to work around JDK bug in ProjectGenerator  Summary: This uses the new utility method MorePaths.relativize() added in D1440821 to work around JDK-6925169 in ProjectGenerator. I also added some logging to help me figure out what was going on.  Depends On D1440821  Test Plan: In fbobjc:  % buck project //Apps/FBFeedCellConfigutationPerformanceTest:workspace --workspace-and-projects % Apps/FBFeedCellConfigutationPerformanceTest/build.sh -a i386 -s iphonesimulator -m local build-tests  Previously, build.sh failed with the error on #4669894. Now, it succeeds.
