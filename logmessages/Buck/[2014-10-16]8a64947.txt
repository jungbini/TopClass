  HttpArtifactCache: don't set "filename" in content disposition  Summary: The jetty server code has an apparent bug where, if this is set, it *always* creates local files to store the contents for multi- part requests, regardless of the config setting we pass in.  So, don't set this on the client.  Test Plan: Ran a build against a HTTP cache server and verified /tmp/MultiPart* files were not created on cache sets.
