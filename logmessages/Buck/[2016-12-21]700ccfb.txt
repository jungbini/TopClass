  targets: support option to enable versioning when using action graph  Summary: This uses the "build"-specific buck config entry which enables versioning to gate whether versioing is used for targets command which build the action graph.  This works well, as if versioning is enabled for building it means `versioned_alias` rules are present in the target graph, which cannot be transformed to actions without versioning.  This also allows keeping versioning disabled for targets commands which don't require an action graph, which is useful for speed and debugging.
