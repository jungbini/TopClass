  Work around CxxLibrary not having output  Summary: * Currently when we try to build an Apple extension with Buck, we fail because we try to copy the output of a `CxxLibrary` into the bundle, but `CxxLibrary` is a `NoopBuildRule` and has no output. In the long term we should fix what we set as the `binary` parameter, but for now let's work around the issue by not building the extension libraries.  Test Plan: * Try building an extension, check that the build does not fail (although the extension is not built).
