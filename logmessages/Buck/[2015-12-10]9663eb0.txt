  Add SuppressForbidden annotation and use in AdbHelper  Summary: To make progress enabling `ant forbidden-checks` as part of the build, we need a way to suppress the checks on legacy code and/or code we know is good.  This adds a new annotation `com.facebook.buck.annotations.SuppressForbidden` and enables its use from `build.xml` to allow us to turn off the warnings.  I added calls to `AdbHelper` to turn off the warning for existing unsafe calls to `String.format()` as an example. (We could also pass a `Locale` into this class if we wanted to fix the errors more properly.)  Technically we could add `forbiddenapis-1.8.jar` to Buck's classpath to get their copy of `SuppressForbidden`, but we're not using it today, so I added our own annotation instead to avoid the dependency.  Test Plan: `ant forbidden-checks`. Before, `AdbHelper` appeared many times. Now, it doesn't.  Reviewed By: k21  fb-gh-sync-id: 442196e
