  Fix Preprocessor Paths on Windows  Summary: This fixes a fun issue with with paths on Windows in our preprocessed files for native code.  `Paths.get("some/path")` will be represented as `some\path` when you call `toString()` on it.  Note that the backslash is not escaped in this string, so if you were to write it out to a file, like we do when we postprocess our preprocessed files, the backslash will simply escape the next character.  This change adds a method and `Function` on `Escaper` to handle this correctly.  Test Plan: * `ant test -D"test.class"="EscaperTest"` * `ant test -D"test.class"="CxxPreprocessAndCompileStepTest"` (was previously failing on Windows) * Ran `AndroidBinaryIntegrationTest.testStaticCxxLibraryDep` in IntelliJ, and see it get further
