  Enforce Eclipse warnings by using ecj as a compiler.  Summary: Update the Ant build to use the Eclipse Compiler for Java (ecj) with strict checks enabled so that we can catch issues at build time, such as missing `@Override` tags. Up until now, I have been manually fixing these errors as I discover them when I load newer versions of Buck in Eclipse (most Buck team members use IntelliJ and are unaware of these violations).
