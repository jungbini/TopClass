  Don't search Ant directory for immutables sources  Summary: When I originally added support for Immutables, I had ant generate the Immutables source files and configured IntelliJ to look in ant's `build/immutables` directory for extra sources.  This was unneccessary and in fact caused IntelliJ to rightly complain about duplicate classes if `ant generate-immmutables` was run before the IntelliJ build.  The fix is easy: just remove the ant `build/immutables` path from IntelliJ's sources path.  Test Plan: ant clean generate-immutables; open IntelliJ; run tests in com.facebook.buck.immutables
