  More logging cleanup.  Summary: - Don't log rule started/ended or step started/ended on the event bus. Instead, log them inline.  This reduces code and/or improves timestamp accuracy.  It also means that thread ids can be used to corellate these messages since they don't have to wait for async dispatch on the bus. - Downgrade rule started/ended to verbose since we generate lots of these on rule key hits for deep projects.  I left Step at debug because these at least represent real work. - Removed the "UNCHANGED" log message.  This can be easily inferred from rule ended. - Made the "BUILDING" message look more like other stuff in our logs. - Added a "build complete" to mark the point right after we finish executing steps (which might be a little removed from when we consider the rule complete.)  These are both debug. - Tweaked style in DirArtifactCache logging code and downgraded hit/miss to debug.  More stuff to look at - How cache events are logged. - How failures are logged. - What we log at each level of startup/shutdown. - What logger name we should use for verbose rule keys. - Log build started/finished inline instead of on the bus.  Test Plan: Did a build with some rule key hits and local builds. - On FINER/verbose, saw lots of good stuff: all of the rule results and verbose rule keys. - Filtering by debug, saw no info about rule key hits, but still lots of info about local builds.  TIDs were consistent to allow correlation. - Filtering by info, just saw "watchman overflowed", "build started", and "build finished".
