  Fix bug in assumption-violations reporting  Summary: The `org.junit.runner.notification.RunListener` used in Buck hooks into a bunch of `test(Started|Finished|Failure|AssumptionFailure|Ignored)` methods and records state to share between them, which it then reports back to buck.  I added a feature where, if an assumption-failure occurred, it was appended to a list of failures on the assumption that the list was cleared each time.  That was wrong, and meant that if a test-class had a test-method in it that had an assumption violation, all subsequent test-method results would be marked as assumption-violation, with the same error:  ``` lang=none, name="before" test-1 pass => pass test-2 pass => pass test-3 av   => av test-4 fail => av test-5 pass => av ```  This fixes the bug by storing each assumption-violation temporarily, between calls to the various `test*` methods:  ``` lang=none, name="after" test-1 pass => pass test-2 pass => pass test-3 av   => av test-4 fail => fail test-5 pass => pass ```  Test Plan: Included a new test in a separate
