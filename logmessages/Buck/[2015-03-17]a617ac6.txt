  Ensure that only one test at a time is run when --debug flag is used.  Summary: When we run tests with the "--debug" flag, we configure the JDWP to use a given port (5005 by default). Since only one process can bind to the port at a time, only one test at a time can be run.  Obviously, a user could do something like:  buck build //some:target && buck test -j 1 --debug //some:target  This is far from ideal.  Test Plan: buck test --all buck kill && buck test --all (watch activity monitor, see the threads) buck kill && buck test --all --debug (see only one java process running)
