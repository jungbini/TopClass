  Update soy contributing docs with logging info  Summary: Now that we have full-fledged logging, this updates the soy contributing docs with info on how to use it.  I also updated the stylesheet to fix a few issues:  1) Tables were unstyled.  2) We forced a horizontal scrollbar on <pre> sections even when it wasn't needed.
