  Allow DexMerger to merge multiple dex files at a time.  Summary: Previously, this class could only merge 2 dex files, which led to N^2 runtime when merging lots of dex files.  This version is about 10x faster for my test case (about 100 dex files).  Most of the changes were just replacing "dexA", "dexB", and related objects with lists and maps.  The only complicated part was the hand-implemented 2-way merge algorithm, which I replaced with Guava's Iterators.mergeSorted (which required implementing a proper iterator for the section).  Note that I overwrite the uValue variable on a match because the old code prefers writing the second value.  This should not matter since they are presumably equal, but I figured I might as well preserve the behavior.  Test Plan: This is a port of a
