  Miscellaneous documentation fixes.  Summary: @boval reported that the Quick Start instructions left IntelliJ in a state where it associated a package named "java.com.example.activity" with the android_library code rather than "com.example.activity." This was because the Quick Start instructions failed to reference the necessary update to .buckconfig.  Also fixed some spacing issues.  Test Plan: Inspect locally at http://localhost:9811/.
