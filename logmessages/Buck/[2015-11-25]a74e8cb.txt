  Fix Python launcher failing to use buckd if run outside of project root  Summary: I found some engineers were running buck from directories outside the root of the repository.  In this case, the Python launcher would fail to connect to `buckd`, because we were passing it a relative path to the Unix domain socket which was hard-coded to `.buckd/sock`.  This fixes the issue by updating `pynailgun` to support a `cwd` parameter to tell it to chdir to the project root (and then restore it) before connecting to the socket.  We could pass the full absolute path to the socket, but Unix domain sockets are extremely limited in length (somewhere around 60 bytes) so using a relative path if possible is much more reliable.  Test Plan: `cd` into subdirectory, run Buck command twice. Before, would not use buckd. Now, it does.  Reviewed By: sdwilsh  fb-gh-sync-id: 5095ebd
