  Fix codesign for simulator builds  Summary: Fix codesign for simulator builds. Buck now code signs all builds. Local simulator builds are self-signed. In order to restore the signature after we do un-sanitisation, we should: - support self-signed signature restoration in fix-codesign.py - correctly align `LC_CODESIGN` command and re-tune `__LINKEDIT` so it covers the aligned code signature. Apparently it worked before, but it should be aligned by 16 bytes according to Apple sources.  Test Plan: buck project --build-with-buck, build from Xcode for Simulator, make sure build finishes. Tested on arm64, i386 and x86_64 architectures: set breakpoints in app itself and any staticly linked library. Build & Run - make sure breakpoints hit from within Xcode and correct place in the code is presented.  Reviewed By: Coneko  fbshipit-source-id: 1cb87a9
