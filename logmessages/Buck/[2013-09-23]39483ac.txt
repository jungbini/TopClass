  Downgrade IntelliJ plugin to Java 6.  Summary: According to http://devnet.jetbrains.com/message/5472169, IntelliJ does not support Java 7 right now, which means you can not run IntelliJ using Java 7. Therefore we have to downgrade the JDK version in use of IntelliJ plugin to Java 6. But Jetty 9 (we used as Websocket client) required at least Java 7, so the Websocket client is reimplemented with org.java-websocket.  Another fix: Start Websocket client only with `build` command.  Test Plan: Run plugin and double click a target.
