  Upgrade Jackson 2.0.5 to jackson 2.5.5  Summary:This upgrade was motivated by the need to pick up the fix for https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/585.  Basically, we want to make sure that `BUCK.autodeps` files are byte-for-byte identical, regardless of whether it is run on Windows or non-Windows. As such, we need to be able to specfiy the line endings used by the Jackson pretty-printer.  After downloading the appropriate JARs from Maven, and replacing them in third-party, I ran the following commands to help create this change:  ``` git grep -l jackson-annotations-2.0.5 | xargs sed -i '' -e 's#jackson-annotations-2.0.5#jackson-annotations-2.5.5#g' git grep -l jackson-core-2.0.5 | xargs sed -i '' -e 's#jackson-core-2.0.5#jackson-core-2.5.5#g' git grep -l jackson-databind-2.0.5 | xargs sed -i '' -e 's#jackson-databind-2.0.5#jackson-databind-2.5.5#g' ```  After that, I had to fix up a bunch of Jackson API calls because some of them had become deprecated in favor of new methods. The existing JSON pretty printer that we were using in `AutodepsWriter` was one such deprecation, so I fixed the line-ending issue while there.  Test Plan:* Ran `buck autodeps` and verified that no `BUCK.autodeps` files changed. * CI  Reviewed By: sdwilsh  fb-gh-sync-id: eec12c6 shipit-source-id: eec12c6
