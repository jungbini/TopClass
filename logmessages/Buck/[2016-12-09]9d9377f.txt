  Filter available SDK archs based on subdirs  Summary: When looking for Apple CXX SDKs, look into the .sdk folder and respect architecture subdirectories if it contains them.

Test Plan: Attached to debugger and made sure this didn't change any of the default Apple SDK flavor mappings.  Reviewed By: Coneko  fbshipit-source-id: 7f4534e
