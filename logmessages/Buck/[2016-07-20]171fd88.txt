  Collapse multiple / into one  Summary: A number of people incorrectly use `glob()` in BUCK files like this:  some_library( srcs=glob(['path/to//src/**/*.java']), )  The double-slash typo happens to be treated the same as a single slash with Python `glob()` (and `pathlib`), but it does not currently work with Watchman glob (which uses the `wildmatch.c` library, which always fails to match any pattern with multiple slashes).  I sent a fix upstream to Watchman:  https://github.com/facebook/watchman/pull/310  which sid0 kindly merged, but it will take time to deploy a fix, so this also works around the bug on the Buck side.  Test Plan: `buck build //path/to:target` where `srcs` included a glob with multiple slashes  Reviewed By: ryu2  fbshipit-source-id: 2828a38
