  Add non-dep-file inputs to the manifest key  Summary: The key used for manifest file generation used to be created by using a input-based rule key builder that had been overridden to ignore all of the `SourcePath` components of the rule key. The manifest then contains a mapping of `SourcePath`s that were actually used (and their hashes) to the corresponding dep-file-based rule key. When attempting a manifest-based cache hit, we'd compute the key, pull down the appropriate manifest, and check input hashes against the current state until we found an entry for which all of the input hashes matched what we had on disk.  However, the thing that generates the dep file often has limited purview or is only reporting certain kinds of dependencies. For example, the C++ compiler only lists the header files that were used, not the source.  So the manifest key as currently generated ignores
