  Add daemon integration tests.  Summary: This change adds integration tests which check that the daemon notices a variety of file changes and its invalidates its caches correctly. As well as testing for a number of failures that have been seen in the wild these tests also surfaced a number of inconsistencies between the way the `WatchmanWatcher` and `WatchServiceWatcher` handled relative and absolute paths within `WatchEvents`. This change also fixes those problems so that all Paths are treated consistently and adds comments and tests for the expected Path transformations.  Test Plan: `buck test --all`
