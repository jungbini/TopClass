  Upgrade to Hamcrest 2.0  Summary: Hamcrest 2.0 fixes a really longstanding bug where you couldn't use:  Foo<Bar> generic = ...; Foo<Bar> generic2 = ...;  assertThat( methodThatReturnsGenerics(), hasItems(generic, generic2, ...));  because Java 7 would raise a warning:  Unchecked generic array creation for varargs parameter of type ...  https://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/issues/detail?id=190  Hamcrest 2.0 fixes this. It no longer has a `core` and a `library` jar -- just a `java-hamcrest` jar for Hamcrest itself, plus a `hamcrest-junit` jar for JUnit compatibility.  I took the opportunity to make a single `BUCK` target `//third-party/java/hamcrest:hamcrest` which exports both `java-hamcrest` and `hamcrest-junit`.  Test Plan: `buck test --all`
