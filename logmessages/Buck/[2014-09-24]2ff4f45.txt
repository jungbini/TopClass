  Cleanup the buckconfig documentation.  Summary: * Updated `prettify.js` to fix a bug with `.ini` highlighting for lines that contain only `#`. * Added `class="prettyprint lang-ini"` to `<pre>` tags, as appropriate. * Alphabetially sorted the sections. * Created a table of contents. * Added an `id` to each `<h2>` so that it is hyperlinkable. * Fixed some spacing and wrapping issues.  Test Plan: Run `./docs/soyweb-local.sh` and manually inspected http://localhost:9811/concept/buckconfig.html.
