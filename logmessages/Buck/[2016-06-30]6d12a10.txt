  Fix warning when closing ProjectBuildFileParserPool.  Summary: Any pending requests present during shutdown were unblocked but not removed from the queue leading to a warning.  It's technically possible for the ParserPool to call scheduleNewParserRequest during shutdown if the AsyncFuntion is interrupted between checking the value of closing and requesting a parser. This change also addresses that issue.  Test Plan: manually step through test case under debugger, confirm warning not issued.  Reviewed By: yiding  fbshipit-source-id: 1ccbf53
