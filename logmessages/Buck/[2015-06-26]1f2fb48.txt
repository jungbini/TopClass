  [new IJ project gen] Parse java package from source.  Summary: This introduces a IjProject-specific JavaPackageFinder which attempts to extract the package from from the actual sources instead of trusting the convention. The main reason for this is that IntelliJ will not index sources that don't have the right package prefix specified in the project definition.  Test Plan: CI, generate project, manually inspect output.
