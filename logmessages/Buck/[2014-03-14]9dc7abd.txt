  Pass AaptPackageResources the transitive dependencies explicitly ...  Summary: ... instead of providing it via `ResourcesFilter`.  In order to fix the dirty hack in D1222142, I am going to create a new interface along the lines of `AndroidResourceDirectoryProvider` which will return resource directories and non english string files. It has no business providing these transitive dependencies which are anyway available up front.  Test Plan: sandcastle and updated unit test.
