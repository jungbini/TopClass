is an example of how we [thought we] fixed this for the rest of the repo in anticipation of introducing `buck autodeps`.  The ideal solution is to have a plug-in API for our Scuba integration so that we can exclude this code from the internal Buck repo entirely. The current solution has its own drawbacks, though (see the Test Plan section). In the interim, it might be reasonable to exclude the `BUCK.autodeps` files from the open source build and require external users to generate them themselves.  Test Plan:Applied this change to the open source version of Buck and ran `buck autodeps` on it. The result is that there still end up being local changes to the `BUCK.autodeps` files (but now `./bin/buck build buck` succeeds):  ``` $ git
