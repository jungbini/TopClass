  Pregenerate Android classes that are generated by IntelliJ  Summary: When autogeneration of Android classes (R, Manifest, BuildConfig) is disabled, IntelliJ fails to recognize references to resources.  The fix is to generate these classes during `buck project`. The classes itself are empty (except BuildConfig). I took the exact content that is generated by IntelliJ when autogenerating sources is enabled.  Test Plan: Local testing and instrumentation tests.
