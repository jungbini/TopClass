  Do not rebuild android_resource and dummy r.java if R.txt of deps are unchanged.  Summary: `android_resource` basically runs aapt on its transitive resource rules to generate R.txt and R.java files for that particular module. If R.txt for a module remains unchanged, so does the corresponding R.java.  `DummyRDotJava` takes in R.txt files generated by input android_resource rules, creates a R.java and compiles it.  This change makes it so that if for an android resource rule, its R.txt does not change, we skip re-building all the android resource and dummy R.java rules that transitively depend on the original rule.  Test Plan: ``` $ buck build messenger // change a color in xml file $ sed -i 's/android:background="#FFFFFF"/android:background="#FFFF00"/' android_res/com/facebook/custom/res/layout/generic_error_view.xml $ buck build messenger $ grep BuildRuleFinished buck-out/bin/build.log | grep dummy_r_dot_java | grep -v LOCAL_KEY_UNCHAGED // no output  $ apktool d -s buck-out/gen/apps/messenger/messenger_debug.apk ~/msgout $ grep "ffff00" ~/msgout/res/layout/generic_error_view.xml $ echo $? 0 ```  Also, look at the chrome trace and verify manually that DummyRDotJava rules had success type value as ABI MATCH.
