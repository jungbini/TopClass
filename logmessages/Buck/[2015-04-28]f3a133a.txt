iners in RuleKey generation`, I broke the case where a `BuildRule` contains a field or dep which is a `BuildRule` that:  1) Implements `RuleKeyAppendable`, and 2) Contains a field decorated with `@AddToRuleKey`  I mistakenly thought that any object which implemented `RuleKeyAppendable` would express all of its rule key logic in `appendToRuleKey()`, but that's not the case for `BuildRule`s which use `@AddToRuleKey` on their fields.  In that case, the logic I added in my commit would cause us to invoke `appendToRuleKey()` on the `BuildRule` without actually adding that `BuildRule`'s rule key to the containing object.  This fixes that by ensuring we call `RuleKey.addSingleValue()` on any `BuildRule`s which also implement `RuleKeyAppendable`.  Test Plan: Added unit test. Confirmed it failed with `ant java-test -Dtest.class=RuleKeyTest`.  Applied fix, confirmed test didn't fail.
