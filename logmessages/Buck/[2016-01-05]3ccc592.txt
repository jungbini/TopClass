  Fix Turkish I bugs in AndroidResourceDescription  Summary: `AndroidResourceDescription` tries to filter out various paths under the `res/` directory based on the filename, directory name, or suffix.  Unfortunately, it uses `String.toLowerCase()` to try to do a case-insensitive match on the filename. This doesn't work correctly in languages like Turkish, since the case-mapping rules there for the letter "i" are not the same as English.  This fixes the bug by using the new utility `ProjectFilesystem.isSameRelativePathIfFileExists()` to ask the underlying filesystem whether the path is the same.
