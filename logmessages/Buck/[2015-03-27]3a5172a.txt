  Implement header maps as rules and use them in Xcode projects  Summary: * Implement header map rules for cxx binaries and libraries. * Use header map rules in generated Xcode projects instead of header symlink trees. This reason for this change is to fix Xcode's incremental builds that are broken by symlink trees because Xcode uses the modification times of the symlink file (not its target) to determine whether it has changed.  Test Plan: * `buck test`. * Generate and build an Xcode project. * Check that Xcode incremental builds work when only header files are modified.
