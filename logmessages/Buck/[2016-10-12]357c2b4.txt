  Log Watchman's stderr on failure  Summary: When Watchman fails with nonzero exit code, log its stderr so that we can diagnose the failure later.  Test Plan: * Remove all permissions from Watchman's state directory. * Run a Buck command that uses Watchman. * Contents of Buck's log: ``` [2016-10-12 18:20:27.903][debug][command:null][tid:18][com.facebook.buck.io.Watchman] Watchman's stderr: 2016-10-12T18:20:27,899: [2047561728] while computing sockname: failed to create /opt/facebook/watchman/var/run/watchman/jakubzika-state: Permission denied  [2016-10-12 18:20:27.903][error][command:null][tid:18][com.facebook.buck.io.Watchman] Error 1 executing get-sockname ```  Reviewed By: ruibm  fbshipit-source-id: 7d841fe
