  Update Python Nailgun client to handle socket.error exceptions  Summary: Users on Linux reported the new Python Nailgun client was leaking `socket.error` exceptions.  This caused the client (at least on Linux) to incorrectly exit with an error code when shutting down the server, since the server abruptly closes the socket without sending an exit code when we do that.  This fixes the Python client to turn `socket.error` exceptions into `NailgunException`s with code `CONNECTION_BROKEN` to mirror the behavior of the C client.  Now, the Buck wrapper for the Python Nailgun client will correctly ignore connection broken errors when shutting down the server.  Closes https://github.com/facebook/buck/issues/534  Test Plan: `buck clean; buck build buck` on Mac. Asked original bug reporters to test patch, they confirmed it fixed the issue in the Gerrit repo.
