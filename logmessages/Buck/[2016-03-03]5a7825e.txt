  Make "as" point to the C compiler frontend  Summary:Until now there was no single place in our codebase that would read the location of the `as` tool in the `CxxPlatform`. Instead we just used the C compiler to compile assembly. Since having an unused field is pointless, there are two ways to fix it: either remove it or put the value that is actually used in there. I have decided for the latter, partially because we already have `asflags` that contain flags meant for the C compiler when compiling assembly, partially because for example for iOS it is not appropriate to use the `ClangPreprocessor` and `ClangCompiler` for assembly code because when `clang` compiles assembly, it does not support many of the features it supports when it compiles C or C++ code.  Test Plan: `buck test`, and compiling some assembly with Buck.  Reviewed By: Coneko, andrewjcg  fb-gh-sync-id: 08d2fc4 shipit-source-id: 08d2fc4
