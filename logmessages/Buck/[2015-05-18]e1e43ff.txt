  AndroidBinaryGraphEnhancer: fix missing first-order deps in rules  Summary: - Previously the `initializeFromDisk` method of the aapt package rule tried to read the output from the `ResourceFilter` rule, which is a dependency.  In general, the `initializeFromDisk` methods must not check output from other rules (since, in a top-down build, we just pull the first order deps and initize them from disk, which means their deps won't be available). - The aapt package rule needs deps on all the non-empty resource rules since it needs to consume the `R.txt` files they produce. - The package string assets step needs a dep on the `ResourceFilter` rule, if produced, as it caches the names of the generated resource dirs.  Test Plan: added unittests
