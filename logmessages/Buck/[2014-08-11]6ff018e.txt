  Ensure xcode_native dependencies are linked in to binary  Summary: To refer to libraries built by existing Xcode projects, we use the 'xcode_native' rule type. It correctly expresses the dependencies, but binary and test rules which depended on xcode_native rules were not actually linking the library into the final result, which meant we had to hard-code linking them in via the BUCK file.  This fixes the bug and adds a test.  Test Plan: Added test. It failed. Applied fix, test no longer failed.
