  Simplify thread pool cleanup.  Summary: Make BuildCommand responsible for closing the Build it contains, so that BuildCommand no longer needs to be Closeable which fixes thread leaks caused when a BuildCommand is used via the CommandRunner interface and so not closed.  Test Plan: 0) buck test --all 1) buckd 2) while true; do rm -rf buck-out; rm -rf buck-cache; buck build buck; done 3) check that buckd uses less than 100 threads after several runs
