  Added package name to buck install event  Summary:I want to add buck install debug to the plugin. My main problem was the fact that  I needed the installed package name in order to find out to what process to attach, so this adds the installed package name to the install finished event.  Test Plan:The package name received in plugin is valid. It passes all buck tests. 'buck install' still works  Reviewed By: alsutton  fb-gh-sync-id: 95117f0 fbshipit-source-id: 95117f0
