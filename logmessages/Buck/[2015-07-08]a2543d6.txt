  Set target architecture for assembly files in Apple targets  Summary: * Make sure we pass the correct target architecture when we build an assembly file for an Apple target. * Expect `asflags` to already contain `-Xassembler` if it is necessary because some flags (like `-arch`) cannot be prefixed by `-Xassembler`.  Test Plan: * `buck test`. * Build an app for iOS with an assembly source file.
