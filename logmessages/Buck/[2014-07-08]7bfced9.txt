  Introduce new verbose log level  Summary: Previously, the logging facade from Airlift exposed four log levels: error, warning, info, and debug.  I'd like to match fbandroid and fbobjc by adding a "more verbose than debug" level, conveniently called "verbose". By default, this will not be written anywhere, but engineers working on their own systems can enable verbose logging for their areas in .buckconfig.local.properties.  Test Plan: Changed a log message to verbose, confirmed it wasn't logged until I enabled FINER level logs.
