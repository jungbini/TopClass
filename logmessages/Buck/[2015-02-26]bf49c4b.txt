  Adds an `audit dependencies` command to the CLI  Summary: This command takes a list of targets as input and prints all of the targets that those targets depend on. It only prints the immediate dependencies by default, but using the `--transitive` flag will cause it to include transitive dependencies as well. This is mainly useful for automation and small scripts.  This also fixes the incorrect existing documentation. It specified that `input` and `classpath` were flags, when really they are full on commands. Instead of adding fuel to the fire and adding incorrect documentation for this new command, I instead just updated the audit documentation to reflect the way the command is currently used.  Test Plan: * Unit Tests. * Run soy2html, then use SimpleHTTPServer to view the webpage. Confirm that everything looks decent.
