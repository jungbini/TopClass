  Make ProjectWorkspace constructor package-private.  Summary: All callers should go through one of:  * `ProjectWorkspace.cloneExistingWorkspaceIntoNewFolder()`. * `TestDataHelper.createProjectWorkspaceForScenario()`.  In a subsequent revision, I want to introduce some new invariants when setting up a workspace, so I want to make sure all instances of `ProjectFilesystem` are created in a consistent way.  In particular, `AndroidBinaryIntegrationTest` and `AndroidExopackageBinaryIntegrationTest` were using the constructor of `ProjectFilesystem` directly for non-obvious reasons, so I created `TestDataHelper.createProjectWorkspaceForScenario()` to make the motivation behind that usage more explicit. I also changed the parameter types to help ensure it is used only for very specific use cases.  I introduced an interface, `TemporaryRoot`, to unify some uses of `[Debuggable]TemporaryFolder` and `TemporaryPaths`. This made it possible to delete some code.  Further, the introduction of `TemporaryRoot` made it possible to create an anonymous one in `InterCellIntegrationTest`, which made it easier to have it use `ProjectWorkspace.cloneExistingWorkspaceIntoNewFolder()` in favor of the `ProjectWorkspace` constructor.  Note that I had to move `ProjectWorkspaceTest` into the same package as `ProjectWorkspace` so that I could make the constructor package-private and `VisibleForTesting` rather than `public`.
