  Fix robolectric res_directories paths.  Summary: The RobolectricTest rule was using PathSourcePath.toString to construct the paths list that got passed to the runner. The way the string was constructed ended up depending on whether the ProjectFileSystem rootPath was terminated with a slash or not. The tests didn't catch this because they were using a FakeProjectFilesystem with an empty root path. The fix is to have RobolectricTest use the resolver to convert a SourcePath to a Path and then a String.  Test Plan: build buck, run robolectric tests, make sure they pass.
