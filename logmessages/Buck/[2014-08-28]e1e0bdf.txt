  Migrate one test from the root testdata directory into its proper place.  Summary: This moves `testdata/javatestrule` to `test/com/facebook/buck/java/testdata/java_test_get_class_names`. The root `testdata` directory is a historical artifact for integration testing that predates `ProjectWorkspace`.  Because only some of the tests in `JavaTestRuleTest.java` need `ProjectWorkspace`/`DebuggableTemporaryFolder`, I split out the ones that needed it into a separate test, `JavaTestGetClassNamesIntegrationTest.java`. This makes it easier to apply a common `setUp()` method to all of the tests that actually touch the filesystem.  Test Plan: Sandcastle.
