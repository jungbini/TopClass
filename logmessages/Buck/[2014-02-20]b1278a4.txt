  Fix buck-config test.excluded_labels.  Summary: I've moved `LabelSetSelector` into its own class and called it `LabelSelector`.  The buckconfig can now include these selectors, which are a bit more complicated than labels (a label is something like `foo` whereas a selector is something like `!foo+bar` -- in most cases the former, simpler case is common.)  This also fixes a bug in the logic for matching test rules against the `[test] ... excluded_labels = x, y` option.
