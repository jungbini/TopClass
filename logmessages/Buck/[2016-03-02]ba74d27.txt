  Enforce single-threaded access to the ProjectBuildFileParser.  Summary:Concurrent access to the class results in hard to debug corruption issues (if k threads access it concurrently then each of the threads might swap parse results with any of the other k-1 threads). Popping in a 'synchronized' block would definitely solve the problem but it would mask any logic errors leading to concurrent access. I think it's better to crash on incorrect concurrent access instead.  Test Plan: CI  Reviewed By: Coneko  fb-gh-sync-id: 7e958ba shipit-source-id: 7e958ba
