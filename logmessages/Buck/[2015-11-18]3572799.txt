  [RFC] Refactor common rule key factory code into abstract class  Summary: The `DefaultRuleKeyBuilderFactory` contains the code which does the reflective walk of the build rule and adds default properties to the rule key (e.g. buck version).  Since we want this stuff for all our rule keys, all the other rule key factories end up sub-classing this to get this behavior.  However, it's useful for the other rule key factories to use their own special sub-classes of `RuleKeyBuilder` (e.g. to capture all inputs added to the rule key).  Since the `DefaultRuleKeyBuilderFactory`s `newInstance` method returns a `RuleKeyBuilder` type, it makes it
