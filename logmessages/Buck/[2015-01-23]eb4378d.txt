  Fix non-deterministic target hashing  Summary: The JSON parser we use parses JSON objects into `HashMap`s, whose traversal order depends on the hashes of the stored keys, which are not guaranteed to be stable across launches or Java versions. That means that with the current implementation, target hashes might not be stable. To fix that, instead of traversing the provided map in its default traversal order, we will copy the key-value pairs into an `ImmutableSortedMap`, which will ensure that we will traverse the elements in lexicographical order of their `String` keys.  Test Plan: * `buck test --all` + a new unit test. * Running the related tests under Java 8 now succeeds.
