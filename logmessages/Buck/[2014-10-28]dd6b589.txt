  Easy: Fix ant build when immutables used in same library they're defined in  Summary: I hit a bug using a code-generated immutable in the same library it was defined in. This was because we weren't compiling the code-generated immutables before using them.  I decided to follow what we do for javacc and compile them with javac before the rest of the ecj run. This fixed the issue with the ant build.  Test Plan: Changed //src/com/facebook/buck/apple:rules to java_immutables_library() and added an immutable type which I used in another class in that package. Before, `ant default` failed. Now, it works.
