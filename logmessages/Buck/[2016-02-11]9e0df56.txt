  Introduce `buck autodeps` to produce BUCK.autodeps files for Java rules.  Summary:This revision does several things:  * Updates `java_library()` and `java_test()` to support an optional, boolean `autodeps` parameter. * Creates `JavaDepsFinder`, which produces a `DepsForBuildFiles` from a `TargetGraph`. It only creates entries in the `DepsForBuildFiles` for rules with `autodeps = True` in the graph. * Creates `AutodepsCommand`, which is the class that powers `buck autodeps`. It is responsible for: * Creating the `TargetGraph`. * Passing it to `JavaDepsFinder` to create the `DepsForBuildFiles`. * Passing that `DepsForBuildFiles` to `AutodepsWriter` to write out all of the `BUCK.autodeps` files.  Note that this initial implementation is primarily single-threaded and does not cache any information between runs even though there are ample opportunities for both caching and parallelizing work. There are comments in both `AutodepsCommand` and `JavaDepsFinder` that explain where these opportunities arise.  Test Plan:Comprehensive integration test: `AutodepsCommandIntegrationTest.java`. Contains many individual test cases to exercise the various paths through `JavaDepsFinder`.  Because the bulk of the logic to test in `JavaDepsFinder` requires a `TargetGraph`, it is considerably easier to define a `TargetGraph` using `BUCK.fixture` files in a `testdata` folder than it is to construct one programmatically. As such, `JavaDepsFinder` does not have an individual unit test: `AutodepsCommandIntegrationTest.java` provides the appropriate confidence in the correctness of `JavaDepsFinder`.  I ran:  ``` buck test --code-coverage //test/com/facebook/buck/cli:cli open buck-out/gen/jacoco/code-coverage/com.facebook.buck.jvm.java.autodeps/index.html open buck-out/gen/jacoco/code-coverage/com.facebook.buck.jvm.java.autodeps/JavaDepsFinder.java.html ```  and verified that the `com.facebook.buck.jvm.java.autodeps` package has 96% coverage by instructions (85% by branches).
