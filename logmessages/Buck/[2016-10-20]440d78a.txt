  Windows cxx: do not sanitize output binary  Summary: For now there is no need to sanitize binaries on windows.  Another point is that the current sanitizer (MungingDebugPathSanitizer) uses MappedByteBuffer, which cannot be reliably freed on windows (http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=8028683). - This sometimes results in locking binary output which is needed by an archiver (lib.exe) on the next stage.
