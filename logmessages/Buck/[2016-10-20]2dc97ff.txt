  Fixed bug in symlink root resolution and added tests  Summary: Symlink roots were being resolved to incorrect paths, due to subpath(..) not adding a root (i.e. '/') component. Also made some tweaks to loop so that less links are checked.  Added unit tests to check for regressions in the future.  Test Plan: ci run buck against project with symlinks in distributed mode  Reviewed By: shivanker, marcinkosiba  fbshipit-source-id: 1744984
