  Fix variable expansion on Windows  Summary: We try to expand `$VAR` and `${VAR}` on Windows for environment variables so you can, in theory, write one command that works for all platforms with a uniform syntax.  However, that code had a subtle bug that was making a bunch of our tests that rely on genrules to fail because we'd only ever expand the last variable in the environment.  Test Plan: Wrote a genrule with more than one environment variable in it and saw it magically expanded properly with the debugger.
