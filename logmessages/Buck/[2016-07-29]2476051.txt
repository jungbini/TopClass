  Ignore changes to editor temporary files when invalidating caches  Summary: Previously, `buckd` would dump its action graph cache (and part of the parsed `BUCK` file cache) whenever any file was added or deleted.  Unfortunately, text editors tend to create then rename temporary files as part of regular operation. `WatchmanWatcher` would dutifully report these to Buck, which would then dump its cache.  The fix is to ensure we exclude temporary files from the query of changed files when `buckd` asks `watchman` what has changed.  I got the list of temporary files from here:  https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15241  Since we're using globs, we don't currently have support for things like `*.s[a-w][a-z]` so I juse used `*.swp` instead. Sorry, vim users.  I made one change to `WatchmanWatcher`: previously it always passed the `wholename` flag to its globs, but some of the patterns we want to match will only apply to the `basename`. So now we match against either the wholename or basename.  Test Plan: Made a build, edited a file in Emacs, repeated build, confirmed in buckd logs that action graph was not dumped.
