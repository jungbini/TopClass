  CxxBinary should use platform-free build target for preprocessor input lookup  Summary: CxxPreprocessables implicitly requires that the incoming build param upon which to do the traversal is free of platform flavors, as it adds its own.  CxxBinary rules usually are instantiated with a platform flavor, so this one keeps tracks of the platform-free target, without passing through the set of all known platforms to the rule itself, which seems a tad excessive.
