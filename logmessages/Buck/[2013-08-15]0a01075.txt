  Introduce DebuggableTemporaryFolder.  Summary: Frequently, when debugging an integration test, I do not want the TemporaryFolder to delete itself at the end of the test because I want to be able to inspect its contents. A DebuggableTemporaryFolder provides the option to do just that.  This also updates ProjectWorkspace to require a DebuggableTemporaryFolder so that developers will start using this by default.  Test Plan: Sandcastle builds.
