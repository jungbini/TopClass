which fixes heartbeat sending logic by testing the interval between sent chunks after each call to select, rather than just after select timeouts. This fixes problems with erroneous client disconnections when using buckd caused by the SuperConsole constantly sending stderr data to the client, which resulted in no select timeouts and so no heartbeats from the client.  Test Plan: 0) buck test --all 1) buckd 2) set BUCKD_CLIENT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS in bin/buckd to 3000 2) buck build buck, check that it completes without timing out
