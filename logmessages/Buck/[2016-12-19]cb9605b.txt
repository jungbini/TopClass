  Updates to get new DX working  Summary: - Change the way we invoke it to use APIs from the latest version. - Delete some logging code that was spamming the console. - Add our resource-tracking code back. - Add our weakValues calls back. - Make the RegisterSpec interns weak (keys and values).  When  I did my analysis, interning these didn't seem particularly safe (it's a static table whose members contain a reference to an object of unknown type), but if upstream has been using it, maybe it's fine?  Test Plan: - Local benchmarking shows no regression for debug builds. - Redex stats shows no changes for release builds.  Reviewed By: asp2insp  fbshipit-source-id: 2626503
