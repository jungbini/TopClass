  Integration test to surface bug in incremental build of react native resources.  Summary: I believe this can be fixed by including the hashes of relevant inputs to the android_resource() rule in `getAbiKeyForDeps()`. The reason this cannot be included in the rule key of android_resource() is that we need to actually execute the `ReactNativeDeps` build rule first in order to compute this hash.  Test Plan: Test fails because `//js:app#dev,android_res` gets a matching ABI hit.
