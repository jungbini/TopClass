  Port buck launcher scripts to python.  Summary: Hopefully no major bugs this time.  - This handles the Ctrl-C issue where buckd was getting killed when buck build was interrupted. The fix is to change the process group of the child buckd process by calling `os.setpgrp()` in `preexec_fn`. - Correctly pass java.util.logging.config.class and buck.logging_config_file. - Include @jacko's fix to return proper exit code from buck.py. - Bump up nailgun client timeout to 60s.  Test Plan: ``` $ buck build fb4a ^C while it's building. $ buck build fb4a ```
