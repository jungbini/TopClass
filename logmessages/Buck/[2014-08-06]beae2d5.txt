  Add asm as a dependency of jacaco.  Summary: Judicious grepping of the source of jacoco suggests that asm is a dependency. This is something of a Schroedinbug --- I have no idea how this worked before, since the dependency is in the bowels of jacoco.  Test Plan: buck test --all --code-coverage --code-coverage-format xml --no-results-cache python ./scripts/assert_code_coverage.py Runs on the continuous build machines should go green.
