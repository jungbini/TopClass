  Update parsing in TracesHelper to reflect recent format changes.  Summary: This fixes a regression where the command column started being empty on the traces page in the webserver.  I looked through my .trace files and noticed that many of them had a new element at the start of the events array, so I updated the logic to look through the beginning of the array to try to find the element that contains the command that the user ran.  Test Plan: TracesHelperTest Verified that commands appear on `/traces` again.
