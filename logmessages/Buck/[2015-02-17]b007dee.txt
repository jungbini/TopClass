  I thought my days of fixing Eclipse warnings were over.  Summary: Apparently `ant verify-javadoc` does not catch everything I would like it to. It uses command-line Javadoc, whereas Eclipse uses its own Java tools that catch more errors.  Ideally, I would set the following line in `third-party/java/eclipse/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs`:  org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.problem.invalidJavadoc=error  But that requires tweaking a bunch of stuff in `build.xml` to make things work properly, which I don't have the time to do right now.  Test Plan: Verified the yellow warnings icon goes away in Eclipse.
