  Ensure System.exit is called even if we throw an exception all the way to main.  Summary: Encountered an issue in practice while re-working buck's interaction with buck.py whereby an IOException (part of the checked signature of most of the main() machinery) would cause buck to stall waiting on non-daemon threads to die that are never going to.  There are a variety of reasons why IOException should not have been allowed to go all the way to main, but regardless those bugs should be caught more gracefully so that we print the stack trace (just like we would've before) and exit the process so that the user is not confused about the state of the process.  Test Plan: Modify the code to throw an arbitrary IOException and verify that the process now stops as expected.
