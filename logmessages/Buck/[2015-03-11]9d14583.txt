  Upgrade EasyMock to version 3.3.1  Summary: * Upgrade EasyMock to version 3.3.1. The upgraded version should contain a fix for a race condition bug where GC was sometimes calling the `finalize` method of mock objects during recording phase and caused tests to fail if the method was not called later, which caused some of our tests to randomly fail. More information about the bug: <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/EASYMOCK-21> * Replace uses of the deprecated `Capture` constructor. * Replace a `Capture` subclass with a fake implementation.  Test Plan: `buck test`
