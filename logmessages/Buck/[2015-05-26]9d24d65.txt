  Fix buck build on Java 8  Summary: Buck, by default, builds java_library targets with first order deps only, so that transitive dependencies don't considered.  So the target '//src/com/facebook/buck/rules:types' is using SmartDexingStep class that implements Step class. Step class is not used directly by this target and Java 7 compiler is happy about it. However Java8 compiler needs to touch Step class because of default methods and cannot reach it, even though it's contained in the transitive dependency chain:  rules:types => rules:build_rule => step:step  To verify this, the following command can be used  $ buck build  --build-dependencies=TRANSITIVE \ //src/com/facebook/buck/rules:types  To fix the problem for both compilers, add step:step as direct dependency to the rules:types target.  This addresses an issue raised in #312. Closes https://github.com/facebook/buck/pull/317  Test Plan: $ buck build //src/com/facebook/buck/rules:types  on both Java 7 and java 8 should succeed.
