  Use better names for enhanced JavaLibrary rules for BuildConfig.class files to add to an APK.  Summary: When doing graph enhancement in `AndroidBinaryGraphEnhancer` for build configs, instead of adding a `JavaLibrary` to `AndroidPackageableCollection.classpathEntriesToDex` via `AndroidPackageableCollector.addClasspathEntry()`, we now create a `JavaLibrary` and a `DexProducedFromJavaLibrary` explicitly so we can control the names of these enhanced rules and ensure they are sane. The `DexProducedFromJavaLibrary` is added iff pre-dexing is enabled.  An important thing to note is that now `AndroidPackageableCollection.classpathEntriesToDex` does not have all of the classpath entries that the `AndroidBinary` needs to dex. Instead, `EnhancementResult.getClasspathEntriesToDex()` has the complete collection.  This also fixes https://github.com/facebook/buck/issues/187.  Test Plan: `MultipleBuildConfigIntegrationTest` Sandcastle builds.
