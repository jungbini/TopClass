d add to PEX`, the latest upstream pywatchman enabled conditional building with `setuptools`.  Unlike `distutils` which installs everything into a directory:  build/pywatchman/pywatchman/foo.py build/pywatchman/pywatchman/bar.py  `setuptools` builds a `.egg` archive (a ZIP file containing the module):  build/pywatchman/pywatchman-1.2.0-py2.7-macosx-10.10-intel.egg  To add this to `sys.path`, we need to add the full path ending in `.egg`, not just the containing directory.  Since we don't know the name of the `.egg` beforehand, I took a shortcut and just used Python `glob.glob()` to find `*.egg` in `build/pywatchman`.  If there's more than one, we throw an error and tell the user to clean their directory.  I added a debug log to `Main.java` to list the system properties help us diagnose this in the future.  Test Plan: Enabled in `.buckconfig.local`:  [project] glob_handler = watchman  Ran `buck build buck`. Confirmed error failing to import `pywatchman`. Applied fix, repeated test. Confirmed in logs was able to import `pywatchman` and `BSER` encoding was used:  Parsing output of process com.facebook.buck.util.ProcessExecutor$LaunchedProcessImpl@2ef40012 using format BSER...  Made a duplicate copy of `.egg` in `build/pywatchman`. Confirmed error was raised as expected:  ::: Multiple .egg archives found in '/Users/bgertzfield/devtools/buck/build/pywatchman': ['/Users/bgertzfield/devtools/buck/build/pywatchman/pywatchman-1.2.0-py2.7-macosx-10.10-intel.egg', '/Users/bgertzfield/devtools/buck/build/pywatchman/pywatchman-1.2.0-py2.7-macosx-10.10-intel2.egg']. ::: Please rm -rf /Users/bgertzfield/devtools/buck/build/pywatchman and try again.
