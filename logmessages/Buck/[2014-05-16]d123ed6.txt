  Kill any subprocess created by a shell step on InterruptedException.  Summary: @msimpson reported that "Ctrl-C-ing buck test --debug with buckd leaves the port bound forever". The reason that happens is because `JUnitStep` which runs tests is a `ShellStep` which basically creates a new subprocess to run a shell command. This fixes the issue by destroying subprocesses after catching an `InterruptedException`.  Test Plan: buck test --all  Make sure NO_BUCKD is unset. buck test --debug test/com/facebook/buck/rules:rules Attach debugger in IntelliJ and set a debugger. As the breakpoint is hit, Ctrl-C the buck test command. Check that `lsof -i :5005` returns empty results.
