  fix android_prebuilt_aar bug in caching empty directories  Summary: `android_prebuilt_aar` may fail when its using cache dir. The problem is dir `res/` is mandatory, but it may be empty somehow. In such case, the caching is not able to cache the empty directories and cause aapt build fail. For fixing that, I force `BuildInfoRecorder::getEntries` to include empty directories when its calling walkFileTree. This fixing will allow ALL empty directories to be cached.  Closes https://github.com/facebook/buck/issues/234  Test Plan: 1. build quickstart project `buck build app`, nothing wrong; 2. `buck test --all`, nothing wrong; 3. before fixing, when running build with cache, `#aar_unzip__/res/` can't be found, after fixing, an empty is found.  ``` 1.
