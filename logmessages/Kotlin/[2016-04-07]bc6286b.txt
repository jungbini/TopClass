  Compute return type for property getters more safely  Do not call `isError()` on property's type right after creation of PropertyGetterDescriptor because the property has no getter yet (it's created but not yet stored to the property, that happens a bit later), and `isError()` leads to computation of the delegate type, which for delegated properties performs some complex resolution (see `VariableTypeResolver#process`) which relies on the fact that the property already has a getter.  Since the purpose of the original change (883e2e4d) was to support a quick fix which would add the type to a property in an expression like "val x get() = ...", check the type (or initializer) presence in the PSI instead, this is safer and is still suitable for the quick fix.  Also fix arguments to "wrong getter type" diagnostic: previously something useless like "expected Int, actual Int" was reported  #KT-11809 Fixed
