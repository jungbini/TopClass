  Implementation of smart casts for public / protected immutable properties that are not open and used in the same module. DataFlowValueFactory and its environment refactoring: containing declaration is added into factory functions as an argument and used to determine identifier stability. A few minor fixes. #KT-5907 Fixed. #KT-4450 Fixed. #KT-4409 Fixed.  New tests for KT-4409, KT-4450, KT-5907 (public and protected value properties used from the same module or not, open properties, variable properties, delegated properties, properties with non-default getter). Public val test and KT-362 test changed accordingly.
