  Wrong delegation to delegation property in debugger when property defined in another module (KT-12678)  Different bytecode can be generated for delegated property and for non-delegated one. Backend inspects DELEGATED_PROPERTY_CALL to understand the property type, and expects that this information had been already recorded into context. Frontend writes DELEGATED_PROPERTY_CALL into context during body resolve or type inference if type is not present.  Either way in debugger context it may happen that the DELEGATED_PROPERTY_CALL won't be written into context.  #KT-12678
