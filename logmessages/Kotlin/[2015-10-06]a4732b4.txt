  Don't create KClass and KPackage instances in <clinit>  This proved to be a fragile technique, which probably doesn't even improve performance in most cases but has lots of unexpected problems: unconditional initialization of reflection classes, increasing the size of the bytecode, bugs with <clinit> in annotations on JVM 6, inability to support conversion of a class from Kotlin to Java without recompiling clients which use it reflectively, etc.
