  Don't use external annotations in compiler  External annotations will be re-enabled in the IDE later.  This fixes LazyJavaAnnotations which was breaking the contract of Annotations: findAnnotation(FqName) was looking for external annotations, while iterator() did not. This resulted in some inconsistencies in the compiler and IDE tests.  The other way, i.e. making iterator() look up external annotations, would have been too costly for the compiler and with no clear benefit at the moment.
