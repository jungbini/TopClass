  Inter-field dependencies fixed for fields used as context  The problem was that when GivenExpression was used to initialize a feld, the generator did not know that there's a dependency on the receiver of the call inside the expression, so it could place the call before the initialization of the receiver, which caused a compilation error. Now dependencies are tracked explicitly
