  Move IC from Gradle to compiler  Reasons for moving: 1. Integration with Kotlin daemon for Gradle. Gradle bundles Kotlin compiler (kotlin-compiler-embeddable) since Gradle 3.2. There is no plugin isolation in Gradle, so strange compilation errors/exceptions may happen. We decided to fix this problem by compiling out-of-process using Kotlin daemon.  Reasons for moving IC to the compiler: * Better isolation from Gradle process. * Incremental compilation logic is not scattered across two process and multiple modules. * Makes it possible to implement standalone CLI IC
