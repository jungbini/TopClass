  Fix type inference issues for 'if' and 'when'.  Use 'expectedType' (when present) as an explicit type argument for a special construct call. Unfortunately, this approach can't be used for elvis due to other elvis-related inference hacks. Fixes KT-10807, KT-10811. This also affects KT-6189: now we can infer proper type for 'if'.  If type inference for special call failed, and we found no type errors in sub-expressions, report TYPE_INFERENCE_FAILED_ON_SPECIAL_CONSTRUCT error. This (and the hack above) fixes KT-10809: code no longer compiles.
