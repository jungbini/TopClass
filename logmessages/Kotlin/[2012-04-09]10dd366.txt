  CompilerDependencies  Holds reference to runtime.jar and jdk-headers.jar. Paths to these jars are no longer hardcoded.  Many tests now compile runtime before execution. Because of this: * Single test invocation is significantly slower now for some tests * This can be fixed by making tests independent from runtime (this must be done anyway)  Some tests still depend on runtime.jar built by "ant dist", this is to be fixed.
