  Debugger: allow to evaluate kotlin expressions in java files #KT-7549 Fixed  If the context is inside PsiJavaFile, get list of all local variables available in current frame (this logic was removed in 29778311e8e151a2a7aaff4c9c47adb54e70f97c 01.12.2015 Drop unnecesary logic about additional context for lambda in debugger). For each variable create KtProperty inside top-level KtFunction in KtFile and set it as contextElement for KtCodeFragment. This file should have all imports from PsiJavaFile. We do not create properties on top-level because they will be highlighted as top-level vals/vars.
