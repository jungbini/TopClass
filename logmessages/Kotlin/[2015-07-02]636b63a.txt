  Make "reflection not found" a warning, provide a quick fix  Reporting the warning on each "::", as ReflectionNotFoundInspection did, is not correct anymore, because for example name/get/set on properties works perfectly without kotlin-reflect.jar in the classpath. So instead we report the warning on calls to functions from reflection interfaces. This is not perfect either because it's wrong in projects with custom implementations of reflection interfaces, but this case is so rare that the users can suppress the warning there anyway  #KT-7176 Fixed
