  Fix and refactor ExpressionCodegen#pushClosureOnStack  - change Closure parameter to ClassDescriptor, load closure in the beginning - invert and rename boolean parameter, also use it only to prevent pushing dispatch receiver (not the extension receiver) onto the stack because the only non-trivial usage of it is preceded by manual handling of the dispatch (not extension) receiver. This fixes innerOfLocalCaptureExtensionReceiver.kt
