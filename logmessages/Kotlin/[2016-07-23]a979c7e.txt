 ugly fix for failing tests. without the string template, KotlinFilePathReferenceContributor injects a file reference into the string literal, and an unrelated intention (AddAnnotationIntention) tries to resolve it. resolving the reference caches the default contexts in FIleReferenceSet, which caches the order entries of a module in an OrderRootsCache. this creates VirtualFilePointers which are for some reason not disposed properly.
