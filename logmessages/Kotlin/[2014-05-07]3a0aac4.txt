  Simplify type mapping logic in CodegenBinding  - inline asmType to calling getAsmType, which does something more - refactor getJvmInternalName to use getAsmType as well - simplify getAsmType and fix a probable bug in mapping singletons nested in enums (which wasn't reproduced, though a test is added) - delete unnnecessary ASM_TYPE recording for enum entries in CodegenAnnotatingVisitor
