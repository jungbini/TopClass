  Extract generation logic from FunctionCodegen  Create a new class FunctionGenerationStrategy, which is used to specify exactly how the body of a function will be generated. This is made primarily to factor out the hard dependency on PSI in FunctionCodegen.generateMethod(). The PSI element is now optional and is only used for debug information (as an argument to newMethod() and endVisit()). This also helps to refactor the confusing logic about generating default property accessors.  Assert for whether we generate code now for the declared member is now useless, since generateMethod() will be used also for generating any possible members.  Also surround with "if ( != null)" some method call in genJetAnnotations(), as null is possible here
