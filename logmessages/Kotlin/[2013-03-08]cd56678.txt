  Change ANONYMOUS_INITIALIZER from _WITHOUT_CONSTRUCTOR to _IN_TRAIT  "since we made all classes have constructors some time ago", this error doesn't even trigger on a class such as: class testClass { {} } It does trigger on a trait: trait testTrait { {} }  Therefore, the error message should be changed to reflect the new behavior. However, an actual quickfix for this will be more involved. It is not a good idea to simply delete the initializer, since it could contain valuable code that the user wants to keep.
