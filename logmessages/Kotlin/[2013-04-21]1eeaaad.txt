  Refactor method/constructor calls in codegen  - use ResolvedCall where possible - 'call' parameter to invokeMethodWithArguments was used only to generate callee, e.g. in "A()" where A is an expression which can be invoke()'d. In case of constructors and enum entry delegation specifiers there's no need to generate callee, so 'call' is made Nullable with a subsequent assert - remove generateJavaConstructorCall() method, since it did no useful work. Java constructor invocation is broken anyway and needs to be fixed (KT-3532) - minor code style / formatting issues fixed, several methods renamed to better reflect semantics
