ty, fixes CompilerDaemonTest.testHelloApp  The commit was done by @yole in assumption that the function only affects PARF lines generated by compiler, but similar lines generated by daemon infrastructure were affected as well, the mentioned test was failing since. CliBaseTest class was refactored, I place the removePerfOutput function into AbstractCliTest class.
