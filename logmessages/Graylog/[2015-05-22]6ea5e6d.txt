  Change how we handle modals using the submit event  - Instead of always stopping the submit event, only do so when we are going to use AJAX to store the data. - BootstrapModal now will stop the event propagation when no `onConfirm` function is passed as a prop to the component, otherwise will let the submit event take place. - Changed BulkLoadPatternModal accordingly, fixing #1325
