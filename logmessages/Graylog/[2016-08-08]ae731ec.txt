  Reduce production .js files sizes by 51% (#2617)  * Reduce production .js files sizes by 51%  - Do not use the react-hot loader for production builds - Use "source-map" instead of "eval" for "devtool" setting in production builds - Enable source maps in the UglifyJsPlugin for production builds  By not using "eval" for the "devtool" setting we are getting much smaller .js files. Using "source-map" for "devtool" and enabling source maps for the UglifyJsPlugin increases the production build time, but also produces higher quality source maps for debugging.  Before:  - Build time: 0m39.788s - All .js files size: 7.9MB  After:  - Build time: 1m4.028s - All .js files size: 3.8MB  * Do not mangle certain "special" variables  Avoids issues in Rickshaw and other old libraries.
