  Optional disabling of radio node after transport errors cross threshold.  When a user defines the "radio_transport_max_errors" parameter in the radio configuration file and the radio transport encounters an amount of consecutive(!) errors higher than this threshold, it switches its load balancer status to DEAD. Reenabling needs to be done manually after fixing the root cause of the transport errors.
