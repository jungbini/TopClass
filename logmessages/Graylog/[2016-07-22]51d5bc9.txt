Also marking them as decorated and including a helpful explanation in tooltip. * Add license header. * Exluding "streams" field from added fields. * Fixing double analyzer registration.  The PluginStore does not prevent double registration of plugins/exports. This is a workaround to prevent double registration of field analyzers due to the package index being included in the core _and_ at least one plugin. The proper fix would be to prevent double plugin registration, but this is beyond the scope of this PR.  * It is plural, stupid.
