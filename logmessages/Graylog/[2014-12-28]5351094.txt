  use elasticsearch "plugin" to determine current cluster state w/respect to data nodes  * use it to keep the most current map of nodes in memory for quick and easy access * implement a blocking way to get notified whenever the cluster comes back * extend Cluster#isConnectedAndHealthy to include deflector state in check (to prevent writing when the deflector is missing)  fixes #828
