  Move alert conditions and notifications to alerts page (#3145)  * Make stream more prominent in alerts  * Correct alert condition descriptions  We mixed up the "Field Value Alert Condition" and "Field Content Value Alert Condition" descriptions #lol  * Change human name for conditions  "Field Content Value Alert Condition" and "Field Value Alert Condition" are not very descriptive names for those alert conditions, so I am modifying them to make them a bit more clear. This is only for presentational purposes, we will keep internal names, at least for now.  * Remove unneded input field  * Add more alert routes  * Move alert conditions to alerts page  * Remove default email alarm callback from test  When testing an alarm callback, only use the alarm callbacks set for the stream, do not use a default email callback.  * Add new REST resource to handle global callbacks  * Formatting StreamAlertConditionResource  * Add store, actions and routes for new REST resource  * Add feedback to test alert notification action  The test notification action should provide feedback indicating whether the notification was sent or not.  * Small fixes in alert conditions components  * Add feedback to alarm callback store  * Add alert notifications global page  * Display notifications in condition list  * Remove unused attribute  * Remove alerts link from streams list  This requires a more in-depth clean up, but for now removing the button and routes is enough.
