  Create MessagePack singleton provider to avoid PermGen leak.  Prepare the MessagePack instance with a RadioMessage because generating code for the MessagePack template registry is not thread-safe.  Before this, a new MessagePack instance got created for each processed message which eventually lead to PermGen exhaustion. Not sure why the generated classes haven't been garbage collected. (bug in msgpack?)  Fixes #907.
