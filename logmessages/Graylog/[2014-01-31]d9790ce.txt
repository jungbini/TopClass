  holy shit session timeouts  this rather humongous change does a couple of things: - editable user settings for session timeouts - add a REST API access log (for debugging the damn thing) - on 401 in the ajax request, we now redirect to "/" - periodic ajax requests no longer prolong the session (this is the worst change really) - a lot of stuff around passing the stupid timeout value and unit around the templates  fixes Graylog2/graylog2-server#405
