  Ensure correct temporal order in NaturalDateParser.Result  Some ambiguous natural date strings like "last one hour" could lead to a wrong order of 'from' and 'to' in NaturalDateParser.Result. This changeset sorts the resulting list so that the lowest date is always first and thus being used as 'from' attribute.  Ultimately this should be fixed (or at least considered to be fixed) in natty itself.  Fixes Graylog2/graylog2-web-interface#982
