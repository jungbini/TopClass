  Fixing session validation propagation. (#2498)  When a store is initialising before the `SessionStore` is finished validating an existing session, it is listening on `SessionActions.login.completed`. Unfortunately this was not working on certain cases when there was a race between the promise validating the session and the initial call to `SessionStore.isLoggedIn()` in `FetchProvider.json()`. This is fixed by explicitly triggering the `loginCompleted` action, which is also taking over the state propagation in the store.
