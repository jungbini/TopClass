  Fix parseInt usages parseInt(input, [radix]) without a radix can behave in several ways  * if a leading zero is provided the radix will be automatically 8 (Octal) * if the input is prefixed with 0x the radix will be set to 16 (Hexadecimal)  All other values will have a radix by 10 (Decimal) automatically.  In order to improve readability of the code and to add predictable behaviour to the application the radix is explicit set to radix 10 (Decimal) now.
