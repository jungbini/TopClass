  Dashboard usability changes (#2093)  * Allow to create rows at the bottom of a dashboard  Add clearfix so it is possible moving widgets to a new row at the bottom of the dashboard.  * Style changes to dashboards  - Set min-width - Merge widget styles - Fix gridster style selector  * Use a constant layout for dashboards  So far we tried to make the dashboard layout to be responsive with the screen. This was never really working, as widgets were dancing around inconsistently. Trying to manage gridster from react made this even worse, as now it is harder to reset gridster or to make sense when the DOM is changing.  Instead of trying to unsuccessfully do that, these changes are going in the opposite direction: Users can unlock the dashboard and arrange widgets as desired, and that arrangement will be keep in the future, regardless on the screen size. Users can still scroll through the widgets or re-arrange them if they want to, but we won't try to be smart about it.  * Add default widget position again
