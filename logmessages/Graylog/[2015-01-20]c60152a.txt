  skip gc collection notifications for collectors that run mostly in parallel to the application  our defaults ParNew and CMS will run mostly in parallel and can thus often take longer than the default threshold of 1 second unfortunately the JMX api does not tell us which phase, especially of CMS, took long, so we skip reporting the times completely for these collectors  in the future we will add a platform stall detection and report on that, which is a much more reliable indicator that something is wrong  fixes #899
