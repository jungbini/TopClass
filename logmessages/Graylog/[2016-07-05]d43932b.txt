  Keep time zone information when creating widget (#2452)  Absolute time ranges in widgets were getting converted into ES_DATE_FORMAT, which converts the time into UTC, but loses the time zone information from the string representation. As the AbsoluteRange create method parses the date time and tries to keep the time zone information, that resulted in UTC times being converted into local time.  To fix the problem we avoid using ES_DATE_FORMAT, and use ISO8601 instead.  Fixes #2428
