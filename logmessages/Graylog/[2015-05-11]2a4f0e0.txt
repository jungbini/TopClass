  Increase default RecvBufferSize for UDP transports to 64K  While the receive buffer size for UDP-based transports could be configured for each transport, the effective size for the receive buffer was fixed to 8192 bytes by using a FixedReceiveBufferSizePredictor with a hard-coded value.  By changing the default receive buffer size for UDP-based transports to 65535 bytes and using the configured receive buffer size as value for the FixedReceiveBufferSizePredictor, the maximum UDP packet size that can be processed by UDP-based transports is now finally configurable.  As the practical maximum for a UDP packet is 65507 bytes, the default of 65535 bytes for the receive buffer should be fine (at the cost of increased memory allocations).  Fixes #1143
