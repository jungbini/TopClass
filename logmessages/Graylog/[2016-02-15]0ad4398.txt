  Append Graylog node ID to Elasticsearch node name  In order for users to quickly identify the Graylog server nodes running a specific embedded Elasticsearch instance, the Graylog node ID is now being used to generate the Elasticsearch node name.  The previous "elasticsearch_node_name" setting has been replaced with the new "elasticsearch_node_name_prefix" setting which is "graylog-" by default, leading to Elasticsearch node names like "graylog-17052010-1234-5678-abcd-1337cafebabe".
