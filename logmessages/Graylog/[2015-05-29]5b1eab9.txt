 some setups have problems with websockets and even xhr_streaming  this changes the default behavior to use xhr-polling (or even more basic polling techniques), while still allowing to use the websockets.enabled sytem property to turn on support for more permissive environments  the default behavior should now properly use plain xhr requests (or xdr on IE 9), and fall back to jsonp or even iframe polling.  fixes #1344, fixes #1353, refs #1338 #1322
