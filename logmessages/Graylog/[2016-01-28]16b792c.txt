  Removing shared module, passing Store/ActionsProvider in context.  This allows us to share singleton instances of stores and actions throughout all components of the web interface and all plugins.  The shared bundle has been removed, because it prevents hot reloading of shared components. Components which are reused by plugins are bundled into plugins instead of referenced from the shared bundle. This has the downside that plugins need rebundling when components of the web interface are modified (because of bugfixing or enhancements) but it also makes them resilient to API changes.
