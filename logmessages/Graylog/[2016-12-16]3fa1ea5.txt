  UI improvements (#3213)  * Fix loading indicator styling  Use a more specific selector to give precedence to the custom css over bootstrap classes.  * Display all stream actions for default stream  To keep a better visual consistency, display all actions, but disabled those that are not applicable to the default stream.  * Add tooltip to default stream actions  Fixes #3189  * Sort list of indices used in search  Fixes #2852  * Use dot instead of comma  Stream throughput and matching type are not really related.  * Use pluralize on stream rules text  * Remove autoFocus from retention/rotation config  Before they were using individually, but now they are part of a larger form. They should not take the focus away from the first input of the form.  * Add default label to default stream  Also replace stream status badge with a label, which is more spread over the UI and takes less space.  Fixes #3191  * Add index set information to stream list  * Improve styling of stream list  - Move status label a bit up for better alignment - Move action buttons up in the DOM, to avoid overflow problems and also improve alignment  * Ensure index sets are loaded before mounting  Elements inside the stream list require the index sets to be loaded, so now we wait until the store fetches them.  * Show index set details when clicking on title  Fixes #3192  * Make buttons on index sets a bit more consistent  Use same sizes and texts  * Improve texts on index set maintenance  Make clearer which actions affect to all index sets or only the current one.  * Add more consistent styling to index set forms  - Display labels always on top of input - Add some missing labels - Use same save button colour as in other pages - Add spacing between sections  * Improve descriptions in index set pages  Refs #3190  * Improvements in index set configuration form  - Improved help messages - Add basic index prefix validation  Refs #3190
