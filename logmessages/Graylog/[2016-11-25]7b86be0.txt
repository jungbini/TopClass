  Filter indices to search in according to stream filter (#3118)  * filter indices to search in according to stream filter  when searching in a stream we need to take into account its index set prefix to avoid touch all matching index ranges this assumes only a single stream can searched in at the same time (like the decorators do)  fixes #3117  * test filtering index prefix when determining index ranges  * use index sets for index range tests instead of the prefix string
