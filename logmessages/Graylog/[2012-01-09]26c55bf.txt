  Small fix for a bug reported by Robert Charroux <robcharx@gmail.com>. Non-admin users were not able to quickfilter streams anymore, an error stating that permissions are insufficient was displayed instead. This was caused by incorrect action urls generated in the form tag for the quickfilter form. Now it determines if it's operating in a stream scope and decides which route helper to use.
