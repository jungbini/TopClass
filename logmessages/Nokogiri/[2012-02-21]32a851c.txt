 Fix read-after-free bug when deallocating node sets.  This bug was reported by valgrind.  xmlXPathNodeSetFreeNs() traverses nodes in order to check whether a namespace needs to be freed when deallocating a node set. However, we cannot guarantee that the nodes are still there at deallocation time.  This commit moves the tests done by xmlXPathNodeSetFreeNs into Nokogiri_wrap_xml_node_set, at which point it is safe to do so.
