  Revert capturing of errors while xmlCopyDoc()/xmlDocCopyNode() and sync behavior with JRuby.  This was introduced due to https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1196 and https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1208 .  However it turned out, that the change in libxml-2.9.2 was a regression, that was fixed in: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=737840 and libxml-2.9.3.  If I read the libxml sources right, it seems, that xmlDocCopyNode() is not intended to emit any such warnings at all. Only errors leading to a failure of the function are emitted. However these errors should be reported to ruby space in the form of exceptions (this is not yet implemented - currently either nil is returned or a generic error text is raised).  This patch also synchronizes the behavior on MRI to that of JRuby, so that the error list is filled from the parser only and that it is shared after Document#dup .
