  [java] make sure that Xml::Document::encoding is a string with utf-8 encoding.  In order to be consistent with the C-Nokogiri, the encoding string has to be 'utf-8' encoded (per xml_document.c:178). This change fixes Nokogiri::XML::TestDocumentEncoding::test_encoding, but also require a patch to JRuby. For more details see https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/223 and http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-6764.
