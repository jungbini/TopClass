 Fix a memory leak when XSLT.parse fails  In xslt_stylesheet.c, the method parse_stylesheet_doc() gives libxslt an error callback and then invokes xsltParseStylesheetDoc.  Nokogiri's error callback invokes rb_exc_raise() which prevents the function from returning to the caller. As a result libxslt never cleans up after itself and we leak memory.  Additionally, xsltParseStylesheetDoc requires that the caller frees the XML document on failure.  This commit fixes both of the above issues. Note one side effect -- we no longer provide the exact reason for the parser failure in the exception. I added rb_warning() to the error callback so that the error can be seen when Ruby is running with $VERBOSE.  I wrote up description of how I found and fixed this leak at: http://holymonkey.com/how-to-find-and-fix-a-memory-leak-in-a-ruby-c-extension.html
