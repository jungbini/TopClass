  fix #852. Make Nokogiri's class cache thread local  Depending on the ScriptingContainer each thread may or may not have its own runtime. Which means the last runtime that initializes Nokogiri will insert its RubyClass instances in our class cache. This will cause all the other threads to see weird behavior as Nokogiri fails to lookup ruby classes properly. This fix makes the class cache an internal variable per in the Nokogiri module. Thus, we'll have one cache per runtime regardless of whether it's shared between threads or not
