  fix #835. replace the fix for #719 from 0d8c3f2 with a simpler fix (more info below).  The fix for #719 made ReferenceEntity nodes look like text nodes. This caused normalization of the document (i.e. concatenating adjacent nodes) to combine the reference entity node with any adjacent text nodes and create a new text node. When converting the document to a string it was impossible to know if the text came from a reference entity or text node, or both, which caused entities to be printed without the delimiters '&' and ';'.
