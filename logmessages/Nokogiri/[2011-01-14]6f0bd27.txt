  Find <title> simply by 'title' instead of 'head title'.  Give up being a paranoid when libxml2's HTML parser keeps faithful to traditional HTML specifications.  If an element like <noscript> appears in a document head, the parser forcibly closes the <head> section because the <noscript> tag is not allowed inside [*], kicking the following <title> out of <head>.  * In HTML5, <noscript> is allowed in <head>, but libxml2 has not caught up with HTML5 yet:  cf. https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=615785
