  CRuby: Add a node type check when adding a child node to another.  Now Node#add_child, #prepend_child, #replace, etc. will check if a node given is of an appropriate type as a child of the parent-to-be node, based on the DOM specification.  Previously, it was possible to "add" a text node to another text node thanks to the special feature implemented in xmlAddChild().  However, because reparent_node_with() was not aware of it, such an operation could cause a SEGV.  Our JRuby version does not support it anyway, so the CRuby counterpart now explicitly inhibits it from now on.  This should fix #1092.
