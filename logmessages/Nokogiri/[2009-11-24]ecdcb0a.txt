lectors. closes #172 FFI: cleanup. closes #65. adding tests for soap4r adapter and bugfixes.  closes #167 FFI: fixing warning Use FFI::Buffer instead of FFI::MemoryPointer for small, transient native->ruby transfers For some functions, the :pointer arg is only needed to return a pointer or int value, so restrict the copy direction so a Buffer can be used more efficiently. Pointer#null? returns a boolean, so just use it instead of testing it and returning explicit true/false Use Pointer#get_array_of_string() instead of hand-rolled loop Pass callbacks as a block, instead of creating a lambda, to lessen load on GC memoize POINTER_SIZE, so pointer_offset(n) is not doing a type lookup each call adding collect namespaces back in implementing Node#previous_element expanding tests for Node#next_element and fixing a boog. do not need rubygems or muck with load path moving tests around and fixing up the manifest NKF test skipped if it's not defined (e.g., rubinius) on rubinius, exslt date:date() return value does not include the time. locale issue? care < 0. fixing FFI test branching for Rubinius (more generally, platforms that require FFI by default) fixing parse_with return semantics. ...
