  Fix namespace objects' creation. This resovled 2 failures and an error of test_*_splode_* in xml/test_node_set.rb.  However, weird 4 erros have started reporting from test_relax_ng.rb by rake test. All tests have passed when test_relax_ng.rb gets run from test_jruby.rb, but 4 of them report errors from rake test. Perhaps, JRuby caches some sort of states that cause errors. This is really hard to debug since test_relax_ng.rb itself doesn't have any problem. Besides, so many tests run before test_relax_ng.rb in rake test, which makes it hard to figure out exactly what test is the culprit.
