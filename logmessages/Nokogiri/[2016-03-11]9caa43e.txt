  fixes `adopt_as' to relink the namespace of the new node  previously `adopt_as' would call `relink_namespace' on the parent node. this caused a loop such as the following  1000.times {|i| root << root.create_element('randomNode') }  to run in O(n^2) instead of in linear time, since relink_namespace was relinking the root node + 1 child node initially, then the root node + 2 nodes when the second node is added, etc.  fixes #692
