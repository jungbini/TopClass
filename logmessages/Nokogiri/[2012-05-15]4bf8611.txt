  Test for fragment node before assuming a node doc pointer is a doc.  The doc pointer on an xmlNode is not always an xmlDoc. The child of a document fragment will point to the document fragment, which does not behave exactly like an xmlDoc and doesn't have a nokogiriTuple.  This changeset tests for XML_DOCUMENT_FRAG_NODE before assuming that the doc pointer is an xmlDoc.  This changes the NOKOGIRI_ROOT_NODE and NOKOGIRI_ROOT_NSDEF macros to functions which test for this case.  Also check for this case in Nokogiri_wrap_xml_node.  This changeset adds a unit test which was copied from Kristi's bug report.  Reported-by: Kristi <kristi.dev@gmail.com>
