  Changed management of timeouts on remote sockets: now the socket is closed forcing the upper level layer to retry the operation against a valid/new connection. This prevent to receive dirty data for further requests.  The best would be changing the protocol adding a fixed "message size" as integer just after the sessionId. In this way the binary protocol listener could skip the entire message after a timeout without the risk to have a dirty data in socket. Planned for 2.0? I'm going to open a new issue for that.
