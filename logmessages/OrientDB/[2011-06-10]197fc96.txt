  Fixed a bug in concurrency: - adaptive lock can be configured by OGlobalConfiguration - Created new OGlobalConfiguration.ENVIRONMENT_CONCURRENT for this purpose - OSharedResourceAdaptiveLinked class has no sense to exists anymore: removed - segments don't lock the storage anymore but has own lock. This could be removed but it will tested for a while - update and delete record operations lock the storage in exclusive mode, but probably this can be optimized in the next future -
