  Fix FilteredAggregators at ingestion time and in groupBy v2 nested queries. (#3312)  The common theme between the two is they both create "fake" DimensionSelectors that work on top of Rows. They both do it because there isn't really any dictionary for the underlying Rows, they're just a stream of data. The fix for both is to allow a DimensionSelector to tell callers that it has no dictionary by returning CARDINALITY_UNKNOWN from getValueCardinality. The callers, in turn, can avoid using it in ways that assume it has a dictionary.  Fixes #3311.
