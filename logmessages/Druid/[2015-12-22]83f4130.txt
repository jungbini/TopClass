 Merge pull request #2144 from metamx/fixjdbcExtractionNamespaceStartStop  Reorder Before/After in JDBCExtractionNamespaceTest  commit c3374b04e8ca18f426ca965b4e3c6a7756cc23fa  Merge pull request #2143 from gianm/fix-segment-metadata-intervals  SegmentMetadataQuery merging fixes.  commit 83f4130b5f7930efa3c5059f2adeebf0adfcbeab  SegmentMetadataQuery merging fixes.  - Fix merging when the INTERVALS analysisType is disabled, and add a test. - Remove transformFn from CombiningSequence, use MappingSequence instead. transformFn did not work for "accumulate" anyway, which made the tests wrong (the intervals should have been condensed, but were not). - Add analysisTypes to the Druids segmentMetadataQuery builder to make testing simpler.
