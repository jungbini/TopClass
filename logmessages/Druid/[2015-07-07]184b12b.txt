 fix groupBy caching to work with renamed aggregators  Issue - while storing results in cache we store the event map which contains aggregator names mapped to values. Now when someone fire same query after renaming aggs, the cache key will be same but the event will contain metric values mapped to older names which leads to wrong results. Fix - modify cache to not store raw event but the actual list of values only.  review comments + fix dimension renaming  review comment
