  Wait for any pending realtime task to complete before disabling datasource (#3757)  Noticed this in our internal testing, sometimes realtime index tasks in kafkaIndexing service can get stuck waiting for handoff if datasource is disabled before there task completion. This is a workaround to ensure integration tests do not hit this case until https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/1729 is fixed.
