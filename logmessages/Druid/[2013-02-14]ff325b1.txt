 when an action is sent in. Tasks are expected to ensure that this is OK by making their behavior idempotent (since they may be retried after partially completing).  One new kind of request afforded to tasks is the ability to release and acquire arbitrary locks. This will be useful for long-running tasks. Short-lived tasks can still be given a lock automatically upon startup by providing a "fixed interval".  New tables when using db storage: - tasklocks, to support persistence of arbitrary locks. - tasklogs, to log actions taken by tasks
