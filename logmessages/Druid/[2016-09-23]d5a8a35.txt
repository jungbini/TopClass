  groupBy: GroupByRowProcessor fixes, invert subquery context overrides. (#3502)  - Fix GroupByRowProcessor config overrides - Fix GroupByRowProcessor resource limit checking - Invert subquery context overrides such that for the subquery, its own keys override keys from the outer query, not the other way around.  The last bit is necessary for the test to work, and seems like a better way to do it anyway.
