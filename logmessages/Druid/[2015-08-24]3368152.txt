  TaskActionToolbox: Remove allowOlderVersions switch, lift interval constraint.  allowOlderVersions has been stuck true for a while due to a bug (introduced in 566a3a61), but I think it's actually OK this way. I think it's reasonable to expect tasks to choose versions in some way that makes sense, so long as they don't choose one larger than their taskLock version. This is still verified.  The interval constraint was introduced to force tasks to break up their segment insert lists into manageable chunks. They are already doing this, and I think it's reasonable to expect them to do so without enforcement.  Lifting these constraints paves the way for transactional insertion of segments that have varying versions and may be for varying intervals.
