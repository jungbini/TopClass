  Fix ClassCastException in nested v2 groupBys with timeouts. (#3310)  Add tests for the CCE and for a bunch of other groupBy stuff.  Also avoids setting the interrupted flag when InterruptedExceptions happen, since this might interfere with resource closing, no other query does it, and is probably pointless anyway since the thread is likely to be a jetty thread that we don't actually want to set an interrupt flag on.  Also fixes toString on OrderByColumnSpec.
