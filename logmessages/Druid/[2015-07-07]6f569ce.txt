 Merge pull request #1503 from metamx/fix-leaking-zk-nodes  Fix leaking Status Path nodes in ZK  commit 6f569ce9f15963b771f565bed7f0334a484a1701  fix groupBy caching to work with renamed aggregators  Issue - while storing results in cache we store the event map which contains aggregator names mapped to values. Now when someone fire same query after renaming aggs, the cache key will be same but the event will contain metric values mapped to older names which leads to wrong results. Fix - modify cache to not store raw event but the actual list of values only.  review comments + fix dimension renaming  review comment
