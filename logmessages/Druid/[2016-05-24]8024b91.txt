  [QTL] Implement LookupExtractorFactory of namespaced lookup (#2926)  * support LookupReferencesManager registration of namespaced lookup and eliminate static configurations for lookup from namespecd lookup extensions  - druid-namespace-lookup and druid-kafka-extraction-namespace are modified - However, druid-namespace-lookup still has configuration about ON/OFF HEAP cache manager selection, which is not namespace wide configuration but node wide configuration as multiple namespace shares the same cache manager  * update KafkaExtractionNamespaceTest to reflect argument signature changes  * Add more synchronization functionality to NamespaceLookupExtractorFactory  * Remove old way of using extraction namespaces  * resolve compile error by supporting LookupIntrospectHandler  * Remove kafka lookups  * Remove unused stuff  * Fix start and stop behavior to be consistent with new javadocs  * Remove unused strings  * Add timeout option  * Address comments on configurations and improve docs  * Add more options and update hash key and replaces  * Move monitoring to the overriding classes  * Add better start/stop logging  * Remove old docs about namespace names  * Fix bad comma  * Add `@JsonIgnore` to lookup factory  * Address code review comments  * Remove ExtractionNamespace from module json registration  * Fix problems with naming and initialization. Add tests  * Optimize imports / reformat  * Fix future not being properly cancelled on failed initial scheduling  * Fix delete returns  * Add more docs about whole introspection  * Add `/version` introspection point for lookups  * Add more tests and address comments  * Add StaticMap extraction namespace for testing. Also add a bunch of tests  * Move cache system property to `druid.lookup.namespace.cache.type`  * Make VERSION lower case  * Change poll period to 0ms  for StaticMap  * Move cache key to bytebuffer  * Change hashCode and equals on static map extraction fn  * Add more comments on StaticMap  * Address comments  * Make scheduleAndWait use a latch  * Sanity renames and fix imports  * Remove extra info in docs  * Fix review comments  * Strengthen failure on start from warn to error  * Address comments  * Rename namespace-lookup to lookups-cached-global  * Fix injective mis-naming * Also add serde test
