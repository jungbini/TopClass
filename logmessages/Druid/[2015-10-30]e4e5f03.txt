 Merge pull request #1954 from metamx/fix-stupid-aws-limit  EC2 autoscaler: avoid hitting aws filter limits  commit e4e5f0375b538ac7e2a2f7c36d00bd861e584c44  SegmentAllocateAction (fixes #1515)  This is a feature meant to allow realtime tasks to work without being told upfront what shardSpec they should use (so we can potentially publish a variable number of segments per interval).  The idea is that there is a "pendingSegments" table in the metadata store that tracks allocated segments. Each one has a segment id (the same segment id we know and love) and is also part of a sequence.  The sequences are an idea from @cheddar that offers a way of doing replication. If there are N tasks reading exactly the same data with exactly the same logic (think Kafka tasks reading a fixed range of offsets) then you can place them in the same sequence, and they will generate the same sequence of segments.
