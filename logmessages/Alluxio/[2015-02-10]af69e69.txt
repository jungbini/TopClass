 Rebase from master, again, and fix unit tests.  commit af69e691c8973f3fef0d7c4156552b13984ece7d  Address intermittent test failures  There are many tests that rely on an embedded Tachyon cluster running. Lots of these take some action and then need to wait for the workers to update the masters state (or vice versa) before checking their assertions.  They do this by sleeping before carrying on with their assertions.  Due to the vagaries of JVM thread scheduling tests need to wait longer than the heartbeat interval because otherwise the heartbeat may not have yet occurred.  Most tests already do this by sleeping for double the heartbeat interval plus a little bit extra.  However there were a few tests that only waited for a single heartbeat interval so could intermittently fail with no real cause.  This commit fixes up the tests that weren't waiting long enough to use the same longer wait as other tests.
