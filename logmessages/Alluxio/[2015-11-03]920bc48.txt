 Merge pull request #1975 from aaudiber/smallfix  [SMALLFIX] Fix javadoc and formatting  commit 920bc4812a67010eeedc2d13e9ec0befed998bb1  [TACHYON-1167] Significantly speed up integration tests  The default Thrift TThreadPoolServer timeout is 60 seconds. This was causing our integration tests to wait until all outstanding RPCs were resolved before completing. As a result, we were spending half of our integration test time waiting for the Thrift server to stop. This commit fixes this by making the timeout configurable via TachyonConf, and setting it to 0 for tests.
