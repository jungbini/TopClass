 Fix bug with UIWebServer getting the wrong conf (TACHYON-286)  After the configuration changes I found that tests were hanging in my environment and looking at the logs the web server was failing to start properly because it wasn't respecting the test configuration that LocalTachyonMaster created.  The problem was that UIWebServer simply creates a new TachyonConf instance and thus gets the default values rather than it being passed the TachyonConf object by the TachyonMaster to which it belongs.  This commit simply changes the behaviour to do that.  It also improves the logging when the web server starts under a test environment (port = 0) so it actually prints the port chosen for the web server.
