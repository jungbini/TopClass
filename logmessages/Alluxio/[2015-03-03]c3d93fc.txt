 Merge pull request #686 from chu11/workerslaunchingspeed  Workerslaunchingspeed -   Several patches to fix bin/tachyon-workers.sh to speed up launching of workers on a cluster.  commit c3d93fc7cad305a539dacb82965db62ec0bdf601  Fix corner case with killAll  In the event the command line is very long and the keyword being searched for runs out of the column width, killAll fails to kill the appropriate daemon.  This is fixed by simply adding "ww" to the 'ps' command to force unlimited width.
