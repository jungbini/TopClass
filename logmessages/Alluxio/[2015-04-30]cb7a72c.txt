  Updates in integration tests to make it work with local underfs based cluster. Specifically:  - Introduced new pom.xml files for 'integration-tests', 'integration-tests/common' and 'integration-tests/local'.  - The 'integration-tests/common' module contains all the tests needing a cluster. This module has <skipTests>true</skipTests> set, because we only compile the tests with necessary dependencies pulled in here, and don't actually run the tests.  - The 'integration-tests/local' module uses the maven surefire plugin to scan the tests from common module. It then uses the LocalFilesystemCluster.java to run these tests against the local underfs based test cluster. Also introduced a log4j.properties for tests in this module.  - Updated the UnderFileSystemCluster.java to not treat LocalFileSystemCluster as the default cluster anymore, as the local under file system is now moved to a separate underfs module.  - Fixed the erroneous Constants.WORKER_DATA_SEVRER with Constants.WORKER_DATA_SERVER, to fix the build failures in integration tests.  - Updated various pom.xml files to clean up the unwanted dependencies.  - Moved the resource file 'org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem' from core module to clients/hadoop module, where it belongs.
