 Merge pull request #765 from hgschmie/download-fix  Disentangle ProxyRepoDownloadTest from RepoDownloadTest  commit 7e415ec0977e9a947e783752fbd00c5d2e30faa4  Disentangle ProxyRepoDownloadTest from RepoDownloadTest  Turns out that the Proxy test only worked because the RepoDownloadTest had already downloaded the test app and therefore it never actually hit the proxy server. If it did, it would have noticed that it tried to hit it with a relative url first (because localhost:9193 is in the list of repo resolvers) and then tried a wrong url (ending in :9193, not in :9192).  Run the proxy on another port (9194), fix the request URI using 9193, change the name of the proxy app to not be the same as the non-proxy download app.  Both ProxyRepoDownloadTest and RepoDownloadTest are still stateful tests because if they are run multiple times without cleaning out the mod-test folder, the test will not hit the actual server the second and any further time.
