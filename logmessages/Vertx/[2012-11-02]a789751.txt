 Merge pull request #411 from darylteo/json  JsonElement test suite, and fixes  commit a78975170a1507c3068eb558dcb795750208c588  Fix: JsonObject getElement throws Exception  JsonObject throws an exception if the underlying object is not a JsonObject. This is now fixed by checking the underlying data structure FIRST before attempting the casting. If neither condition is met, a ClassCastException is thrown.
