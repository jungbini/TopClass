  Hazelcast3 support including dist files and integration tests  Hazelcast3 support including dist files and integration tests.  Hazelcast 3.2 has some critical bug fixes in it.  To use Hazelcast 3.2 with vertx use the distribution file called:  vert.x.hazel3cluster-${version}.zip or vert.x.hazel3cluster-${version}.tar.gz.  A new gradle jar project was created called 'vertx-hazelcast3'. Vertx uses a service location pattern to load the in a pluggable cluster manager. This fix employs the pluggable nature of vertx cluster manager to plugin Hazelcast 3 instead of Hazelcast 2.  This produces a new jar file that has a new cluster manager factory which can be loaded with the service locator.  It has been tested.
