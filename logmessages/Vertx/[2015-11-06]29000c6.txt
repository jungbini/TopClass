 Merge pull request #1185 from agura/ha_manager_race  Race fixed in HAManager  commit 29000c63a56d5a9410498e39f6ab63567ad7ed91  Changed FileResolver so it can handle nested fat jars  For example, a resource we want to find in a Spring Boot fat jar might be here: app.jar!/lib/dependency.jar!/webroot/hello.html  I modified unpackFromJarURL so that, in the case of a Spring Boot fat jar, it opens the nested jar using getResourceAsStream.  Since we're not dealing with a File anymore, I switched to using ZipInputStream instead of ZipFile.  I also spotted what looked like a copy/paste error in FileResolverTestBase: testRecursivelyUnpack and testRecursivelyUnpack2 were the same.
