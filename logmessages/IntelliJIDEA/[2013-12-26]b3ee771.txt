  IDEA-74428 Ability to turn on log debug categories from the GUI  * Define an action under Help menu. * Selecting the action shows a simple dialog with a text field for log categories separated by new lines (however "," and ";" are also considered as valid separators). * Clicking "OK" applies Log.setLevel(DEBUG) for these categories and persists them. Incorrect category doesn't affect anything. * On start DebugLogManager applies the previously saved categories. * If there were no categories, it reads them from the LogManager, i.e. from log.xml. * Categories are stored in the PropertiesComponent as a single String using newlines as a separator.
