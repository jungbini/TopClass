  Fix github-tests project setup  github-tests were not running on the server, because nobody depended on the module. The solution was either to write the module explicitly to the main-idea-tests configuration, or to move the tests to github module.  Tests were not moved to github module initially because they depend on jira-connector (because tasks-tests depend on jira-connector). Adding tasks-tests test dependency is impossible, because they depend on testframework-java (which leads to prefix problems).  Therefore it is decided to move github tests back to the github module, and add jira-connector as a test dependency to it.
