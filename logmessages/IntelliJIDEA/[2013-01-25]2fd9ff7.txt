  [vcs] IDEA-93399 Don't show message about invalid executable more than once  * Use NotificationManager#getNotificationsOfType & custom Notification type to check if notification has already been shown. (it will be re-shown if event log has been cleared) * Make invalid executable notification STICKY_BALLOON by default: since we show it only once it should be visible. * Some minor reformatting & notnulls in ExecutableValidator.  Additional fixes not to show the notification twice in certain situations. * HgErrorUtil#isAuthorizationError: if result is null, don't treat it as auth error. * Don't throw VcsException from GitHistoryUtils#history. Supply the exceptionConsumer instead. Don't continue gathering history if exception has happened.
