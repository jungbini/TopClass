  [git] Wrap the VcsException not to loose the cause  Before the stacktrace was taken from the processTerminated and was rather useless: VcsException: fatal: bad object b97d4813424a4e75ee1a17c0f2de772359bde26e at git4idea.commands.GitSimpleHandler$1.processTerminated at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor39.invoke <...> at com.intellij.util.EventDispatcher.dispatch at git4idea.commands.GitTextHandler$1.processTerminated <...> com.intellij.execution.process.ProcessWaitFor$1.run  The fix is to show the stack trace of the code which actually called the command which failed with exception.
