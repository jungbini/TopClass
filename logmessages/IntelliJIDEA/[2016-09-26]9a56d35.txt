  Make VCS toolwindow available for projects with <Project> mapping  The issue was introduced in 8f6589d: default mapping is a valid mapping and shouldn't be checked here.  This fixes IDEA-161752.  Previously the availability check used ProjectLevelVcsManager.getAllActiveVcss(), but this check became less powerful in 00adb8e: it stopped initializing active VCSs if they weren't initialized yet. This functionality might return back, but it will be done separately.
