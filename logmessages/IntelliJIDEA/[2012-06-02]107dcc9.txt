  [merge] Display applied changes; allow applying both sides of a conflict.  OVERVIEW: Don't hide highlighting markers on "apply", as it is done on "ignore". Instead use a lighter highlighting: remove the background and paint a separator with a color of change type (red for conflict, green for insert, etc.). Show, what has been changed, i.e. highlight both original side and the applied change in the base/result side.  For conflicting changes, on apply neither remove nor apply the second "variant" of the conflict. Instead propose to apply (or ignore) the second variant below the first one. This fixes IDEA-36811 "Add ability to merge in lines from both left and right in three way merge".  DETAILS: * Define Change#onApplied handled
