  IDEA-100008 IDEA server goes into network using proxy settings from HttpConfigurable before application initialization - do not assert calls without application, just make them through + an attempt to pass proxy credentials to Apache HttpClient API used for connection -> with no success since Apache only pass credentials if secure connection protocol is used (a bug) did not work before common proxy, so keep as is for now
