he given excluded branch filter. Branches are filtered by the VisiblePackBuilder, so there will be no extra commits.  The downside is that the first pack of commits returned by the VcsLogProvider can be in reality very small when additionally filtered by branch => an extra request to the VCS will be needed.  Git itself doesn't support such a filter, so this can't be fixed there. Hg probably does, so the filtering method can be improved there.
