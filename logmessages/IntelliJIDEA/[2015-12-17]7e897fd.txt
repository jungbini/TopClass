  ES6. client debug:  source url is correct on meteor side. our smart solution works  we don't need to setup mappings, we find script by content.  so... why we stopped at first line in the client/app.js?  Well... because there is a breakpoint in the server/app.js. As we set breakpoints only by file name, not but by file path, one VM breakpoint serves _2_ IDE breakpoints. And there is a clear comment in the LineBreakpointManager  "we must not remove vm breakpoint - it is used for another ide breakpoints". So, we just not remove VM breakpoint and it hit. And we stop.  Solution  fix "hasBreakProblem" and filter it out on suspended.  Well, we can implement specific solution for meteor, but... I am not going to fix debug for each tool on the planet. Generic solution is a bit complex, is a bit slower, but it is generic. Save our time and time of our users.
