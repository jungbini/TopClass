  [git] IDEA-89754 CRLF hook: enable for all platforms + fixes.  * Enable the check for all platforms: it is possible that a Mac user occasionally accepts a patch made on Windows with CRLFs. Define RECOMMENDED_VALUE, which is input for non-Windows. * Call the right command in check-attr. * Force separators detection. Since LoadTextUtil is used for this purpose, remove getFileDocumentManager from the PlatformFacade, and add getLineSeparator instead. * `git config` returns with exit code 1, if no value is set to a property. Emulate this in tests, don't check the result on success in the code.
