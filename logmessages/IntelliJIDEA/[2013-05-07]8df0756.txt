  Introduced BatchSuppressableTool which, unlike CustomSuppressableInspectionTool, provides SuppressQuickFixes, not SuppressIntentionActions. SuppressQuickFix doesn't need Editor so it can work in batches. These fixes are available via BatchSuppressManager. Reworked some inspections to extend BatchSuppressableTool instead of CustomSuppressableInspectionTool since they don't need Editor anyway. Similarly, instead of BaseJavaLocalInspectionTool there is BaseJavaBatchLocalInspectionTool.
