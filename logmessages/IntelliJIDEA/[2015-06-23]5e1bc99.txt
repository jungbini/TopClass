  stream provider  introduce processChildren Ability to reduce lock calls and reduce search operations (will be important in case of read-only sources) Skip hidden or directory by default.  Simplify readSchemesFromProviders logic  could be the same as "read from file" because now stream provide is much closer to FS (opposite to old idea-server design) and number of possible issues are not actual anymore (yep  we rely on FS/GIT)  Use the same file name filter for readSchemesFromProviders as in case of "read from file"  Extract base test case from GitTest and add LoadTest to cover fixed functionality.  Get rid of async flag  ignored in any case.
