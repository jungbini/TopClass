  For #PY-2748 Fix false positives, rename issues, add tests and minor fixes according to review  * Don't process renaming string literal expression if it's PyKeyValueExpression: it corrupts user's code by renaming only key-value expression and leaving substitution key the same * Pass isPercentString as constructor parameter, use PyPsiUtil.flattenParens(), rename method(process...-> resolve...) * Fix false positive with function call and add tests * In percent string resolve to all literal expressions, not only string literal * In RenamePyLiteralExpressionProcessor always throw IncorrectOperationException
