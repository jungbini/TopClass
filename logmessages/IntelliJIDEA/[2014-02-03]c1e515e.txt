 [git] Don't read default commit message from .COMMIT_EDITMSG  This actually reverts 07af6c9fa (apart from code style changes). It fixes IDEA-119753 and adding a newline after successful commit.  The root cause is actually CommitChangeListDialog#setComment where the VCS CheckinEnvironment is asked even if we have some commit message in history, which is then overwritten by the message received from the VCS. It seems more logical to ask VCS _only_ if we have nothing to propose, but on the other hand, in such situations as merging it is very handy to use a pre-populated message from VCS, rather than the previous commit message as IDEA proposes. Implementing some sort of commit message provider priority seems to be an overhead for all of this => reverting commit which caused commit message to be read from the VCS more often looks like a better decision.
