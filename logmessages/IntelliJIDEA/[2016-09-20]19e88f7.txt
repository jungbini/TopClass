  PY-20783 PY-20863 Fix resolving of references inside f-strings for nested scopes  Only resolve inside f-strings injectstion should be flow-sensitive. Other kinds of automoatic injections of Python language, like injections inside type comments and forward references inside quoted type hints, do not depend on CFG. In particular, it should be possible to resolve references in them to symbols defined later in the file. Previous fix for the PY-20783 inadvertently broke this behavior for type hints.
