  IDEA-56893 Right line in editor not rendered properly after unfolding.  1. Added gutter sizes invalidation after fold region expansion via click on placeholder; 2. Modified IJ modules configuration in order to locate 'boot' module before jdk classes at classpath. That makes debugger navigate to correct source of the class that belongs to 'boot' module and replaces standard JDK class (standard IJ configurations add 'boot' module's content to boot class path);
