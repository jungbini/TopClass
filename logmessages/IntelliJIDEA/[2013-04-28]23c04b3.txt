  [git] IDEA-102290 Fix south panel for Untracked files dialog  The bug was caused by the fact that SelectFilesDialog called init() in its constructor, therefore the descendants were unable to customize the dialog by passing data via instance fields from the constructor, because, for example, getSouthPanel() was already called in super().  To solve this make SelectFilesDialog.init() for those who need just to use the dialog, and don't call init() from SelectFilesDialog() for those who need to extend it.
