  [git] Implement ability to use the native Git for HTTP(S) connection  Use native command line Git for HTTP connections via GIT_ASKPASS environment variable, to be able to get rid of the JGit library.  Method description. The communication logic is very similar to what is already implemented for SSH connections. * Define the GIT_ASKPASS environment variable pointing to a script generated by the ScriptGenerator. * When Git requests username and/or password for an HTTP connection, it calls the script defined in GIT_ASKPASS. * The script starts the Java application GitAskPassApp and passes the Git request to it as command line arguments. Git process waits for the app to return user credentials to the app's stdout. * GitAskPassApp requests the credentials via XML RPC from the main IDEA instance by calling correspondent methods of the GitAskPassXmlRpcHandler. * Before Git command is called, a GitHttpAuthenticator is registered in the GitHttpAuthService to receive any XML RPC requests about HTTP authentication. * Once the XML RPC request is received, the GitHttpAuthenticator either takes the password from the password safe, or shows a prompt to the user in a modal dialog. * Response is provided back to the GitAskPassXmlRpcClient, which returns it to the GitAskPassApp, which in turn returns it to the Git process.  GitHttpAuthenticator details: * The key for password safe is url + login (see makeKey()). * If password is asked, then the URL contains the login inside URL, and the key is ready. * If username is asked the key is constructed and is searched for in the settings (GitRememberedInputs). * If no username is specified in the URL, Git queries for the username and for the password consecutively. In this case to avoid showing dialogs twice, ask for both credentials at once (AuthDialog) and remember the password to provide it to the Git process during the next request. * We can't store the credentials enter by user in the settings and the password safe right after they have been entered, because user can enter incorrect credentials. Therefore, listen to the Git process output (GitHandler#addAuthListener) and analyze whether authentication was successful or failed. If it was successful, ask GitHttpAuthenticator to remember the correct credentials, otherwise forget them (since they could have been taken from the password safe, not from the user). * Because of this, all other data (url and login, or url with login if the password was requested) is saved to the instance fields.  This change fixes all issues opened because of JGit problems: * authorization issues: IDEA-97178, IDEA-102201, IDEA-100617, IDEA-98189 * connection and proxy issues: IDEA-83984, IDEA-92519, IDEA-96205 * IDEA-77411 self-signed server certificates (although we can provide more user-friendliness by proposing to set http.sslVerify to false in the UI). * IDEA-100096 client SSL certificates. * other: IDEA-78744, IDEA-77992, IDEA-76982, IDEA-78310, IDEA-86083, IDEA-92163, IDEA-94167, IDEA-99159, IDEA-100097  Known drawback: No retry. If user enters incorrect credentials, he will see the failure notification and will need start operation again to supply correct data this time.
