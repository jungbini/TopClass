  [log] IDEA-121948 Possibly fix "row doesn't exist" exception  executeWithoutRepaint was called twice during setting filters: in the runUnderModalThread & in applyGraphFilters. However, the VcsLogGraphTable wasn't aware of such possibility => the very first unfreeze unfreezed everything, although details filters were not yet applied.  * Remove the unnecessary executeWithoutRepaint from applyGraphFilters. * Make it possible to call executeWithoutRepaint several times: use a counter instead of a boolean.
