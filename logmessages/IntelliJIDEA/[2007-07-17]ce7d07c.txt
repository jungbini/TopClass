  svn rename package fixed again: previous version didn't work because renaming a package actually does both PsiPackage and PsiDirectory rename (see RenameProcessor.preparePackageRenaming() and RenameProcessor.prepareDirectoryRenaming()), and the second rename failed on checkSetName() because a directory with the new name already existed. Now we fire an event on rename unconditionally, and refresh directory on command end to cause directory with old name to reappear.
