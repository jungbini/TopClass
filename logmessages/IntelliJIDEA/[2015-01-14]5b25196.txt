  Platform: ListTable/ListTableModel fixes: 1) first cell was always selected when TAB was pressed during editing. Fix: event.consume() 2) editing, adding and removing elements should scroll to the effected element 3) pressing 'add' when last element is empty should focus it and edit, otherwise isn't not clear, why  'add' doesn't work. 4) a bit more compact view (interlaced spacing removed, stripes added)  5) ListTableModel should send notifications, when value in a cell has been changed
