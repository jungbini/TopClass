c84c2 IDEA-104846 Fix pushing new branch without new commits * b200615c for new branch show commits which are not pushed yet  The right fix for this issue would be to identify probable remote for the new branch before showing push dialog, but this change may be too dangerous for 129, so just reverting the changes which led to the problem.
