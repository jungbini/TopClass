-determistic bug when the document commit thread is loading the AST via PsiFile.getNode() during the commit (new behavior in 94863a8df423d3568167f709371d42c7410d0946) and thus setting a non-null value to the tree element pointer while the AWT thread has already set the tree element pointer to be null. The AWT thread in this test should be the last one to reset the tree element pointer.
