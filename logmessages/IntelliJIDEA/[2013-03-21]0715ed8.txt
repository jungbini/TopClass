  [git tests] Let cucumber tests be Heavy  * Don't use LightIdeaTestFixtureImpl, because Git tests need to work with real file system, and because their manipulation with project and its services may affect other light tests. Use the HeavyIdeaTestFixtureImpl instead. * Since with HeavyIdeaTestFixture the project dir is recreated after each test, no need to clean it up manually. There is also no more need to protect against project files deletion, because the project is recreated as well. => remove GitCucumberLightProjectFixture, substitute it by standard fixture initialization. => remove UsefulTestCase#shouldDeleteTempFilesOnTearDown().
