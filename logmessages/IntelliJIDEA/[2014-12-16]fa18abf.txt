  Fall back to resolving super class expression if its type is not PyClassLikeType (PY-11541)  This chanage fixes a regression that was introduced in the fix to PY-11541 for AST-based 'str' class in __builtins__.py.  Currently 'basestring' has type 'str | unicode' for Python 3. This means that it is not added to the list of the class-like super types of 'str'. Now we try to resolve super class exrpressions to classes as a fall back mechanism and return the types of these classes.
