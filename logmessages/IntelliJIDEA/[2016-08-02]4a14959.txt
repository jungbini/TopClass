dding "Signed-off-by" suffix to the commit message.  There was an idea to add a toggle button which wouldn't call "-s", but modify the commit message in place. However it appeared that this process could cause confusion in several cases, e.g.: * user usually signs commits in this project; * he opens the commit dialog, the signature is already there at the end of the previous commit message; * the commit message is selected to ease writing new commit message; * user starts typing, everything gets erased => * should the sign-off suffix be added or not? The button is still toggled, because it is a project wide control. The checkbox is a bit less neat option, but lets avoid such confusions.  The state of the checkbox is remembered in Git project settings.  Several methods became non-static to avoid passing 3-4 parameters which can be easily retrieved from the class fields.
