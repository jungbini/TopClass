  Finally we reduce level of default project settings hack to minimum. No more fragile logic (save inside getState(), boolean flags),  no more double save (it is was impossible to fix it correctly).  Also, default project state is not loaded on ProjectManagerImpl initialization, so, VFS roots assert works correctly in tests (because ProjectManager.openProjects is used, but it was totally wrong  we use VFS to load state from disk (it is another issue why we load configs during tests))
