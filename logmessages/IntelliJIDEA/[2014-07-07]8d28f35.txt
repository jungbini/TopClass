 - DebugAssertions.DEBUG is enabled for EAP / internal mode - introduced / used ValueIterator class to be able to get file set associated with given value without hash map lookup with m.b. costly hash code calculation (IDEA-125200) - during particular value loading and calculating merged data if given key has number of values more than threshold calculate / use direct mapping of fileId -> Value instead of traversing all values (thus removing O(NumberOfValues) per fileId)
