  SpellChecker plugin: redesign plugin configuration - use project level instead of application one; simplify quickfixes - replace 'Add To Dictionary' and 'Add To Ignore Words' with 'Accept As Correct'; add new rules applied for splitting text: remove html parts from comment content, exclude from checking too short words, exclude from checking the terms that were defined beyond the project source code, exclude from checking the names of identifiers that coincider with types names
