  Fixed hg outgoing and incoming changes - authenticate  After fix for IDEA-64523 (removing passwords from hgrc) hg outgoing & incoming should require authentication now. HgIncomingCommand, HgOutgoingCommand and HgChangesetsCommand are adjusted to authenticate.  HgCommandAuthenticator logic has also changed: 1. Try to execute command. 2. If authentication needed, try to get it from the password safe. If it doesn't exist, show auth dialog. User has 3 attempts to authenticate. After successful authentication passwords are remembered in memory, if "Remember password" was not checked, and on disk, if "Remember password" was checked.
