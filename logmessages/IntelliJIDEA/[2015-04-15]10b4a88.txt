  [git] IDEA-137636 fix column size for interactive rebase dialog  * Extract calculation of column size based on header + content from JBTableHeader to JBTable. * If there is no header renderer or the header itself, return the same 15 as the header width which is set as min size in TableColumn. * Set both max & preferred size to the column, as setting just preferred size is not enough (it can be ignored by the complex JTable resizing algorythm).
