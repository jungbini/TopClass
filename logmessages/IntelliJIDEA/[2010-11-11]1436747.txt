  Hotfixed failure of execution of any remote ssh git operations on Windows. FileUtil.createTempFile -> File.createTempFile()  because the first one returns canonical path (e.g. C:\Documents and Settings\...) while the latest one returns short path (e.g. C:\DOCUME~1\...), and msys git doesn't understand spaces in paths of environment variables (GIT_SSH, for instance) and won't fix it (http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/issues/detail?id=203).
