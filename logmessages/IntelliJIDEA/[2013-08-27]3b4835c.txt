  1) methods "void setPresentation(@NonNls String name, @Nullable Icon icon, @NonNls @Nullable String type, @NonNls @NotNull String separator, @NonNls @NotNull String value, boolean hasChildren);" and "void setPresentation(@NonNls String name, @Nullable Icon icon, @NonNls @Nullable String type, @NonNls @NotNull String value, boolean hasChildren);"  were removed  it was deprecated some time ago  2) now we always escape and trim "name"  it was implemented only in Python Debugger, but useful for all  name could be dictionary key. 3) get rid of separator from API (API is not broken, methods just marked as deprecated). Unify approach to show "grouping value".
