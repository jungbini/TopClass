  IDEA-101361 Copying file from hg ignored directory and adding it to VCS problem fixed.  *How to reproduce: try to copy unversioned or ignored file, then  hg ask you to add it to vcs,when you say "Yes" file will be copied,but not added to vcs. it happens because hg can't perform "hg copy" action with unversoned source file. * if source file is not under vcs the copy command should be replaced by add command.
