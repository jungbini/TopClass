  IDEA-92994 Integrate project with mercurial shows local changes as 'Changes from server' in conflict ui. Update fix for  IDEA-81214.  *Change merge provider: first parent - local revison, second - server *When you perform pull, update and merge -  do not update head to new revision (server revision) * Note: merges in Mercurial are not symmetrical!  If I hg update to 17 and then hg merge with 23, Mercurial records 17 as the first parent of the merge, and 23 as the second. etc...This may produce misunderstatnding.
