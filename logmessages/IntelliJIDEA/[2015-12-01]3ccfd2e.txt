  Fix multiprocessing debug with breakpoints in both main and child processes (PY-17092)  When the new process is created, the main thread in the new process already has the attribute '__pydevd_id__', so the new thread doesn't get new id with its process number and the debugger loses access to both threads. Therefore we should update thread_id for every main thread in the new process.
