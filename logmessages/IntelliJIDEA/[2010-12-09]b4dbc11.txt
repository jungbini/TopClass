  GitBranchWidget refactoring. Introduced GitBranches project service to keep and track branch information (for now only current branch per root). Introduced GitBranchesListener interface to listen to changes in branch configuration. Renamed GitCurrentBranchWidget to GitBranchWidget. Moved all 3 classes to git4idea.branch. Also fixed: if current file is unversioned, show nothing in the widget.
