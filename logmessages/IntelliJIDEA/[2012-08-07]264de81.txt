 CRLF is about to be committed to the repository. Step #2  * Write the detector according to the following algorithm: - check core.autocrlf - check if files to commit have CRLFs - check if there are CRLF-related attributes on these files. * Respect multi-roots.  Tests: * Write a test on the detector and the parser of the output of `git check-attr`. * Try one more approach on unit testing Git: declare GitTestImpl as more real Git implementation than MockGit is: this one calls git. The tests are fast enough. * Several fixes and enhancements in the mocks. * Introduce GitExecutor which allows a nice syntax of calling to Git. This can be used as a mixin in tests.
