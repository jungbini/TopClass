ommitLegendPanel: instead of a complex 3x4 grid use something as light as "New: 1 of 20  Deleted: 3 of 30  Modified: 4 of 4" Don't say "1 of 1" if all changes are included. * Move the section beyond the changes browser, above the commit message area. * Adjust the default proportion of the splitter between changes browser and commit message to let it look better on small window sizes.  After the summary section was compacted, it started to look really empty at the right panel of the Revert dialog and the Apply Patch dialog. To fix this in the RollbackChangesDialog: * Move the changelist selector to the changes browser toolbar (as was already done for the commit dialog). * Move the summary & "delete locally created files" below the changes browser.  To fix this in the ApplyPatchDifferentiatedDialog move "summary" below the changes browser as well. Also, remove the second GridBagLayouted wrapper panel, and simplify grid bag constraints usage.
