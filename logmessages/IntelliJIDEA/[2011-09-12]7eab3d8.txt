  IDEA-68586, IDEA-72062, IDEA-70926, better fix for IDEA-72302 - encoding fixes for Mercurial  Default encoding for Windows is cp1251, for unix-systems it is UTF-8. Store these values in HgEncodingUtil. Use them in HgCommandExecutor and HgCommitCommand. Don't ignore the charset parameter in ShellCommand. Better parsing in HgChangesetsCommand: don't split in 4 parts (the separator is kept in that case), assert 4 parts.
