  IDEA-53596 Soft wrap for editors  Second soft wraps implementation iteration. Current state: * soft wraps are represented at the editor during its repainting; * line numbers representations is consistent with soft-wrapped lines presence; * logical position representation is consistent with soft-wrapped lines presence; * foldings are correctly represented at gutter during soft wraps adding/removing; * active line background is drawn correctly in situation when single logical line is sread to multiple visual lines;  Bugfixes: * editor repainting was incorrect during vertical document scrolling;  Other: * green code policy is applied whenever possible. Most of the time these are minor rename refactorings to make spell checker plugin happy;
