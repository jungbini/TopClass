  IDEA-135522 First click to gutter after popup menu is not handled  Remove the flag myPopupInvokedOnPress, since it is effective not for direct mousePressed-mouseReleased cycle, but stays for the next mouseRelease as well, thus preventing the click to be handled.  The reason why mouseReleased is not called for the right click - because the event is consumed in invokePopup. That also fixes the issue, probably for which the flag was introduced.
