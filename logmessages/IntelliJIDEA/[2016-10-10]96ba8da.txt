  Reset PythonDialectsTokenSetProvider automatically in PyTestCase#setUp()  to fix failing PythonInspectionsTest#testUnusedLocalFStringReferences() (when it's run as part of PythonAllTestSuite).  Otherwise, the exact token sets become dependent on the order in which tests are executed because some of them such as PyLexerTestCase register PythonDialectsTokenSetContributors and re-initialize the provider explicitly and then leave it in this state for the following tests. This might cause some subtle bugs when PSI operations that require IElementTypes other than those defined in PythonTokenSetContributor break down all of the sudden. In particular, this is relevant for Python fragments injected in f-strings and comments since PyDocstringLanguageDialect uses special token type for reference expressions.  It seems better to reset the provider automatically once and for all than to fix it in #setUp() for every single affected test like it was done e.g. for PyOptimizeImportsTest.
