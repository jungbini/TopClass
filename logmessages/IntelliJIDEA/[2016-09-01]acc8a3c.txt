  [vcs-log] fix root label behavior in "branches expanded" mode  In "branches expanded" mode details have a horisontal scrollbar. That means root label has to be carefully drawn not in the corner of the panel but rather in the corner of the viewport. 1. Location of the root label is now calculated carefully using viewport location and vertical scrollbar width. 2. myMainContentPanel is not automatially resized to fit the viewport in this mode, so its width is manually calculated in order it to fill the whole viewport.
