  [git] HTTP: fix password dialog cancellation; store password manually  * IDEA-102862 If the dialog was cancelled, return "" instead of null, because XML RPC doesn't understand nulls. * Mark all getPassword() as @Nullable to avoid similar problems in future. * Remember the entered password into myPassword to store it later if authentication succeeds. The password is stored anyway in PasswordSafePromptDialog#getPassword(), but it is incorrect behavior that will be fixed later.
