  Revert previous fix in custom folding descriptor: copy indentation again  Python formatter does not correctly align closing comment after first method in class if opening comment was aligned on first column. The problem is that left margin of block that corresponds to statement list is determined by its first child. If this child is incorrectly indented line comment, all later comments will be aligned wrongly as well, because their blocks have 'none' indent in parent.
