  Don't try to map code fragment to source name. Often, sourcemaps is not detailed - token is not mapped to token, so, it is not easy to extract identifier from code fragment So, if source map doesn't provide name mappings, we assume that names are not mangled.  GWT mangles name (https://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=9106 https://github.com/sdbg/sdbg/issues/6 https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-135356), but doesn't add name mappings. So, in this case we implement custom normalize member name.  Fix isInLibraryContent (CallFrameView uses it to select appropriate font color)  we must use source file to check, but not script file.
