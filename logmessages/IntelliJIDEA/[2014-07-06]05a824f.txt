directly in the UI after commit fails => remove the "fatal:" prefix as well as the debug info "during executing ...". In this particular case this info is not necessary even in the log, because it is clear that it happened during commit.  Before the fix commit message looked like: "fatal: No existing author found with 'bar' during executing git commit -F <some params> --author=bar <more params>" Now it looks like that: "No existing author found with 'bar'"  A better fix would be to add some "presentable message" field to VcsException.
