  Hide GitHub credentials from the settings  Ground: * It fixes AE happening because of the necessary fix for IDEA-78716. * It makes master password not appear during navigation through the settings.  Remove host, login and password fields. Rename "Test" button to "Change credentials", fix layout. Pressing the button invokes the standard GithubLoginDialog with credentials filled from the GitHubSettings (possibly with master password prompt). Connection failure notification is not needed, since the dialog doesn't allow to OK on failure. Connection success notification is shown, fix the parent of the Message.
