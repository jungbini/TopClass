  IDEA-130889 push dialog cosmetics: community repository is truncated  * TreeUI  with NodeDimensionsHandler overrides to avoid problems with initially wrong node sizes; * component listeners added to track current scroll bar size and update node sizes according to it; * setRowHeight moved  to the end of push log constructor, because it calls resize and repaint components; * set minimum tree size and use it as minimum node size when scroll bar is not initialized yet; * note: add DebugMarkerBorder in RepositoryNode renderer if needed
