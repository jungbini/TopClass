  [vcs] IDEA-114233 IDEA-114570 IDEA-130082 Remove useless long read actions  * These read actions don't synchronize access to VcsDirtyScopeImpl fields. * It might be needed to identify the root for file correctly, but correct fix for it is requires a lot of changes (and will follow just for master branch) * On the other hand, currently many operations "around" these methods don't use read actions, so skipping it here shouldn't cause more troubles. * Also, if in the absense of a read action a root changes and we get invalid information, later a separe event about this root change will follow and will cause re-refresh of file statuses.
