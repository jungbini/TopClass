 CPP-6592 Lazily collect threads and frames on stepping (part 2, files with no logic change)  + send only one stop reason per thread from LLDB + some unnecessary SetSelectedThread/SetSelectedFrame calls removed + always send execute console command to LLDB (in stead of trying to send to the debugged process) + threadId migrated to long (as in LLDB) + additional tests for threading + error stack frame removed (it could lead to class cast in CidrDebugProcess.getCurrentThreadId/getCurrentFrameIndex)
