  Update binary skeletons path on every SDK update and clean up obsolete paths (PY-15499)  Sometimes paths to binary skeletons in jdk.table.xml used to become corrupted or invalid. There used to be no way of fixing that since the paths had been added there only once during the SDK set up. Now we restore them every time the SDK gets updated. The paths should be in the jdk.table.xml because they are the part of SDK paths and they are required for indexing. Indexing contributors don't allow to associate paths with modules.
