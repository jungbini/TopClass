  [vcs-log] inputs index is not needed in log  * InputsIndex is null for log indexes. * Common persistent set is used for keeping indexed status. * Remove myEmptyCommits from paths index and myNoTrigramsCommits from trigrams index. Commits with no paths or no trigrams wont be re-indexed now since they will be stored in the persistent set. * Remove PrintIndexInfo action, not very useful and used for debug. * Rewrite create/dispose code for indexes. Each constructor now throws an exception if something's wrong and all indexes are cleaned-up and recreated together if it is.
