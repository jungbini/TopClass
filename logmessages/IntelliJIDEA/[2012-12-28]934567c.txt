  [git] executable detector: fix for default project  When there is no myPathToGit, and Settings is open before opening any project, GitVcs is not activated, and there is git.exe in the Settings instead of fairly detected executable.  Solve it by returning to the previous logic: detect the executable right away in getPathToGit. Remove  redundant getPathToGitAtStartup. Remove calling detect from GitVcs#activate since it will be automatically called from getPathToGit().
