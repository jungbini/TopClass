  Move to GitHub API v3, refactor. IDEA-85769  * Introduce getRequest() and postRequest() methods as entry points to do a query to the API instead of doREST, which requires releasing an HttpMethod and so on. * Return parsed JsonElement from these methods, since Github API returns the response in JSON format. * Post request in JSON format as well. Get-methods are not called with parameters yet, so don't bother for them. * Use these methods from GithubCreateGistAction which already uses API v3. * Introduce getApiUrl to return the correct API url for github as well as for enterprise installations. * Introduce GithubUser to encapsulate information about a user. Currently it works only for the current user, and stores only its plan to know if private repositories are allowed for the person. * Rewrite RepositoryInfo to be a structured holder of the information about a repository, without working with DOM elements and so on. Rename some methods to make their return value more obvious. * Add @Nullable, @NotNull, javadocs,  code style fixes. * In the GithubShareAction move initial pushing to the background to avoid the modality lock with the dialog asking for the passphrase. This fixes IDEA-86645.
