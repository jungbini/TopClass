  The problem to solve: print to the console which is not yet shown, then the console would appear empty. Restoring dumpImmediate breaks another case: show; clear and print in the same awt event. In this case alarm request would work after print was performed => console would appear empty.  The fix is about clearing alarm queue more accurately: the requests which were already put on AWT thread should not be performed if cancelAllRequests was performed before they could start. [anton]
