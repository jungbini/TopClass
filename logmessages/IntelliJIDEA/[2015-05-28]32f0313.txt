  Modal Progress Indicator: repaint immediately to update indeterminacy  * The ProgressDialog doesn't receive any update() events after it has been shown (unless the PI gets changed) => myProgressBar.isShowing() is never true => the indeterminacy state gets never updated.  * The check myProgressBar.isShowing() was introduced back in 2006 within d28a3b6 with a comment "NPE in Swing code caused by progress bar's indeterminate property tweaking is most probably fixed", but according to the code of JProgressBar, the NPE is not possible there, at least not in JDK 1.6+.
