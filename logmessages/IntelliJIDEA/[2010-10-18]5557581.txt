  Git: fixed history problem with null bytes in git log --pretty (IDEA-59554). Refactored GitHistoryUtils. Introduced GitLogParser which knows how to parse git log output for the format given (in friendly way) to its constructor. And GitLogRecord which is a friendly representation of information of one revision. For GitChangeUtils didn't refactor - just changed %x00 to %x03. More tests for GitHistoryUtils.
