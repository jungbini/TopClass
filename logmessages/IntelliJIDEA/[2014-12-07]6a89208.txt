  [git/hg] While reading .git/refs don't put fake hashes in case of error  * Skip them and log error. * Make RepoStateException checked, to make sure the logic is handled in all necessary cases. * Keep unchecked exception (use IllegalStateException) if a critical error happens during repository initialization (e.g. .git/HEAD is missing). * Remove GitTestRepositoryManager since overriding update() is not needed anymore (it doesn't throw the exception anymore). It automatically fixes IDEA-132298.
