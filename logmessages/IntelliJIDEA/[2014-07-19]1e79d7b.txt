  [log] Simplify & fix refs comparison API & implementation  * Change VcsRefManager.sort to getComparator. * Define ContainerUtil.sorted to return new list instead of sorting in place, since this pattern is used a lot. * Clarify javadocs to clearly indicate what does each compare result mean. * Fix GraphColorManagerImpl#compare according to this meaning & simplify comparison delegation to VcsLogRefManagers.
