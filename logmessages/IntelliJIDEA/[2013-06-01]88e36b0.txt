  Don't recreate MainFrame and other components on each refresh  * Create MainFrame once at the startup of VcsLogManager. * Get rid of the ControllerListener and setState-stuff. Just call mySwingUi.updateUI/etc when needed. * Remove the statusUpdater from everywhere, use ProgressIndicator.  This introduces a circular dependency between swing_ui and ui_controller, that will be fixed later.
