 [git] Fix non-ASCII paths unescaping problems  Fix GitUtil.unescapePath as proposed in PR#123: i is incremented in the inner loop even after the octal part finishes => it should be decremented back, so that next character is not missed. Add a test. (https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/pull/123)  However, it doesn't fix problems with unicode paths containing diacritic symbols (in spite of PR#218 which proposes fix for IDEA-132150). Such paths are always returned by Git in octally-escaped NFD (decomposed) form, while on disk and/or in the repository they can be stored in NFC or even non-normalized form.  Therefore make Git return unescaped paths by passing -c core.quotepath=false to all commands. This option is not supported for Gits older than 1.7.2 - they will still receive escaped paths and use patched unescapePath(). Others will receive those characters which are stored in Git database.  This won't fix the situation if a non-normalized path is stored to the repository on Linux/Windows and then checked out on Mac (which HFS+ automatically normalizes to NFC on read/write): the path on disk won't match the path in repository.  But for other cases this fixes the following issues: IDEA-84715, IDEA-116247, IDEA-132150
