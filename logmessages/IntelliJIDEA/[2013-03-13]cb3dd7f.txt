  [tests] Create individual temp directory for each test run  To avoid problems when the previous test run is terminated abnormally and therefore leaves the dirty temp dir.  Introduce UsefulTestCase#shouldDeleteTempFilesOnTearDown and override it in GitCucumberLightProjectFixture instead of overriding shouldContainTempFiles(). Thus temp directory with a random suffix will be created for each test run, but will be deleted only on application exit.
