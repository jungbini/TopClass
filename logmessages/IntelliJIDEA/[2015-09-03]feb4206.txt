  Better parsing of Numpy docstring with empty section indent  Also field parsing is stricter now and it can't be parsed if parameter name isn't valid Python identifier.  As soon as I fixed parsing of Numpy docstring format it caused errors in multiple tests that used types of function parameters, because previously in these places docstrings couldn't have been parsed successfully (they were treated as Epydoc docstrings) and PyNamedParameterImpl#getType delegated to NumpyDocStringTypeProvider. I explicitly prohibited using of NumpyDocString for this purpose before NumpyDocStringTypeProvider is migrated to the newer docstring API.
