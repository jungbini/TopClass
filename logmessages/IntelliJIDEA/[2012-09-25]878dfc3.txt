  Since Idea 12 built-in xml rpc server was superseded netty-based general purpose http server. Your channel handler (registered via extension point, pipilene consumer) decides if incoming request addressed to him and then can upgrade connection to what you want. Initial request is http message, but then you can remove all unneeded channel handlers from pipeline.  Backward compatiblity: root path (/) is used by xml-rpc channel handler, but any new must use not-null path (as example, LiveEdit/JS Debugger websocket channel handler uses "/jsonRpc").  WebSocket implementation is not moved to platform, I think, it is not needed. (cherry-picked from fde5a10)
