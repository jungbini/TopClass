  [tests] Fix running our Cucumber tests from IDEA  * Add a runtime dependency to cucumber-test-runner module to ruby-tests and git4idea. Otherwise CucumberMain can't be specified as a runner in the run configuration. * Remove dependency on the Application from CucumberMain, just call EventQueue.invokeAndWait. * Move application initialization to git and ruby hooks - to the place where correct platform prefix can be defined.
