  IDEA-64835 hg: support auth dialog cancellation  1. HgRemoteChangesetsCommand - common ancestor for HgIncoming/OutgoingCommand. All common functionality moved. 2. HgChangesetsCommand.executeCommand - override for remote commands. No more isAuthenticationNeeded(). 3. HgRemoteChangesetsCommand.executeCommand: if user cancelled the dialog, show notification and disable checkboxes for checking incoming/outgoing changes. 4. HgCommandAuthenticator: 3 attempts for authentication error; if other error - return; if auth passed - save credentials and return; if cancelled - return special HgCommandResult.CANCELLED (and show notification in the client - see #3).  TODOs for disabling checkboxes: 1. Disable not for project, but for repository+project. 2. Expire the notification once the problem was fixed.
