  [git] IDEA-78808 Fix "yours" and "theirs" for manual conflict resolve  * Introduce GitMergeProvider.detect() that checks the state of each repository, and fills a map that is further used to check if a reverse merge meaning should be used for the given root.  Keep GitMergeProvider(boolean) that allows to specify the reverse setting for all roots at once - for those cases when we know whether reverse provider should be used or not (i. e. when an action is executed from IDEA).  Reverse provider is used for rebase and unstash, but we can detect only rebase, not stash (IDEA-77051).  * Make GitVcs use detection when asked for the default Merge Provider (this actually fixes IDEA-78808, because GitResolveConflictsAction uses the default provider). Remove unused method and fields.  It is very unlikely that one root would have unresolved conflicts after a merge, while another would have unresolved conflicts after rebase, but it is still possible, so we can't just take the first root with conflicts and treat it as an etalon for reversing the provider.
