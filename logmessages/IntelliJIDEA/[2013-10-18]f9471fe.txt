s sourceUrl in case of redirected script, so... oh, ma! init WEB-6659 JS Debugger stops at arbitrary point in code  well, set by url is not reliable way due to Chrome bugs Now we set breakpoint by script id. This way is slow, but solves our problems init WEB-6413 sourcemap backed breakpoints do not work until page is loaded  we pause script on first line now, so, we can check sourcemap too.
