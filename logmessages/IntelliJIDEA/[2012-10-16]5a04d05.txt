  GitRepositoryReader: fix hash values used for branches.  1. manually add packed branches one-by-one, to avoid the log-error from GitBranch.equals(). We want to keep this log-error to catch possible programmer mistakes. The algorithm is less efficient, but that shouldn't be a problem because even a thousand of branches seem to be an impossible case.  2. trim() hash values so they don't contain \n at the end.  3. read hash value if repository is rebasing.
