  [vcs] Fix Add to VCS for Git  * Remove GitAdd action since it duplicates the functionality of ScheduleForAdditionAction & CheckinEnvironment#scheduleForAddition. * Let ScheduleForAdditionAction be enabled if user selects a directory, and the VCS doesn't support directory versioning. That would let to add all files in a directory recursively for Git and similar VCSs. * Since directories may now be presented in the data passed from ScheduleForAdditionAction to the ChangeListManager, don't add everything that is found there: check for unversioned files. * Add a test on 'git add'.  This fixes IDEA-104070 & IDEA-76670, because all files are now handled individually, and hidden or ignored files simply don't count. This also fixes IDEA-98689, because the common action is used now, and its shortcut can be reassigned.
