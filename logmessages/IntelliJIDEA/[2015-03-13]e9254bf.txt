  Fixes issue restarting on Linux  On Linux when the updater runs it does so by restarting the ide via a while loop in the bash script. However the bash script is not run again. This has two problems: . If we update the bash script itself, these changes are not picked up. And this includes for example changing the selector directory. . VM options files and other config data is not read again so if we change them as part of the update, they will not be picked up.  This change fixes both issues by re-launching the script if the IDE requests a restart.  https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/137800/2
