  [log] Store the reference to the current repository root in Branch  Walking from a node to the nearest reference can be expensive => store the current root in Branch objects (there is not too many of them, so it is safe in terms of memory usage).  Branch is created from another Branch, or from a leaf node, which has a reference label on it (and VcsRef has information about the root). The only exception are tags, which are not provided by GitLogProvider yet, but this is no be fixed shortly.
