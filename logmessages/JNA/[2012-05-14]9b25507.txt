  Make Netapi32Utils.getUserInfo(String,String) work.  Netapi32Utils.getUserInfo was ignoring the parameter for the domain name, which caused it to fail when the "domain" name was not actually a domain controller.  On fixing that, I got an error about the SID being in an invalid format. It seems like JNA's "PSID" is actually just the SID, so to get PSID you have to use "PSID.ByReference". This is bound to confuse someone else in the future so it might be worth renaming PSID to SID?
