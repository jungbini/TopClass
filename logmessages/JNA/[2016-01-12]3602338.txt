 Make (Un)marshalling context sensitive  Depending on the context the unmarshalling of the supplied data in callbacks is unwrapped further than before. The NavigateComplete2 event from the interface DWebBrowserEvents2 demonstrates this. The URL is passed as a Variant pointing to a Variant containing the string. Without this fix NULL is returned.  To test this ComEventCallbacks_Test.java was moved to use Internet Explorer instead of MS Office.
