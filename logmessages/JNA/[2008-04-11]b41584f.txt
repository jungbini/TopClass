  fix test failures on amd64 with 64-bit jvm. Classloader/path was using "build" instead of "build-d64". NOTE: I considered changing and re-using the ["vmopt.arch" value="-d64" else="-Dignore"] already defined in build.xml for this, but I wasn't sure what the "-Dignore" case was intended for.  git-svn-id: https://svn.java.net/svn/jna~svn/trunk@543 2f8a963e-d2e4-e7d0-97bf-ccb7fcea9d80
