 The powerpc64 support opted to pass floating point values both in the fpr area and the parameter save area, necessary when the backend doesn't know if a function argument corresponds to the ellipsis arguments of a variadic function.  This patch adds powerpc support for variadic functions, and changes the code to only pass fp in the ABI mandated area.  ELFv2 needs this change since the parameter save area may not exist there.  This also fixes two faulty tests that used a non-variadic function cast to call a variadic function, and spuriously reasoned that this is somehow necessary for static functions..
