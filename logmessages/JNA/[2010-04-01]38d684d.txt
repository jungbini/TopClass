  Used generics for several existing utility classes, fixing warnings (platform is built with Java 1.5+). Split FileUtils into win32, mac specifics so we can write os-based unit tests just like W32FileMinotorTest. Fixed exception in W32FileMonitor which throws an unhandled exception when disposing because the watched handle is closed. Modified W32FileUtils and ShellAPI's SHFILEOPSTRUCT to support unicode paths. Fixed ShellApi structure alignment introduced in a previous check-in. Readded LastErrorException string constructor.  git-svn-id: https://svn.java.net/svn/jna~svn/trunk@1058 2f8a963e-d2e4-e7d0-97bf-ccb7fcea9d80
