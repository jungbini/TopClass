  closures: Create temporary file with O_TMPFILE and O_CLOEXEC when available  The open_temp_exec_file_dir function can create a temporary file without file system accessible link. If the O_TMPFILE flag is not defined (old Linux kernel or libc) the behavior is unchanged.  The open_temp_exec_file_name function now need a new argument "flags" (like O_CLOEXEC) used for temporary file creation.  The O_TMPFILE flag allow temporary file creation without race condition. This feature/fix prevent another process to access the (future) executable file from the file system.  The O_CLOEXEC flag automatically close the temporary file for any execve. This avoid transmitting (executable) file descriptor to a child process.
