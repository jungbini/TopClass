  KAFKA-3945; Change the type of 'acks' config in console producer to String  The `acks` config that is provided to console producer with `request-required-acks` comes with `all`, `-1`, `0`, `1` as valid options (`all` and `-1` being interchangeable). Currently, the console producer expects an integer for this input and that makes `all` to become an invalid input. This PR fixes this issue by changing the input type to String.
