  HOTFIX: open window segments in order, add segment id check in getSegment  * During window store initialization, we have to open segments in the segment id order and update ```currentSegmentId```, otherwise cleanup won't work. * ```getSegment()``` should not create a segment and clean up old segments if the segment id is greater than ```currentSegmentId```. Segment maintenance should be driven not by query but only by data insertion.
