  KAFKA-1686; Implement SASL/Kerberos  This PR implements SASL/Kerberos which was originally submitted by harshach as https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/191.  I've been submitting PRs to Harsha's branch with fixes and improvements and he has integrated all, but the most recent one. I'm creating this PR so that the Jenkins can run the tests on the branch (they pass locally).
