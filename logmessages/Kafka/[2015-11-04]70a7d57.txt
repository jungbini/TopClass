  KAFKA-2722; Improve ISR change propagation.  The patch has two changes: 1. fixed a bug in controller that it sends UpdateMetadataRequest of all the partitions in the cluster. 2. Uses the following rules to propagate ISR change: 1) if there are ISR changes pending propagation and the last ISR change is more than five seconds ago, propagate the changes. 2) if there is ISR change at T in the recent five seconds, delay the propagation until T + 5s. 3) if the last propagation is more than 1 min ago, ignore rule No.2 and propagate ISR change if there are changes pending propagation.  This algorithm avoids a fixed configuration of ISR propagation interval as we discussed about in KIP-29.
