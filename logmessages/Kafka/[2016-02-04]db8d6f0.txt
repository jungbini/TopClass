  KAFKA-3179; Fix seek on compressed messages  The fix itself is simple.  Some explanation on unit tests. Currently we the vast majority of unit test is running with uncompressed messages.  I was initially thinking about run all the tests using compressed messages. But it seems uncompressed messages are necessary in a many test cases because we need the bytes sent and appended to the log to be predictable. In most of other cases, it does not matter whether the message is compressed or not, and compression will slow down the unit test. So I just added one method in the BaseConsumerTest to send compressed messages whenever we need it.
