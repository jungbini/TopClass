  KAFKA-3152; kafka-acl doesn't allow space in principal name  * Add quotes to `$` in shell scripts This is necessary for correct processing of quotes in the user command.  * Minor improvements to AclCommand messages  * Use a principal with a space in `SslEndToEndAuthorizationTest` This passed without any other changes, but good avoid regressions.  * Clean-up `TestSslUtils`: Remove unused methods, fix unnecessary verbosity and don't set security.protocol (it should be done at a higher-level).
