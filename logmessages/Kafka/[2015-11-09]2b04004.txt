  HOTFIX: bug updating cache when loading group metadata  The bug causes only the first instance of group metadata in the topic to be written to the cache (because of the putIfNotExists in addGroup). Coordinator fail-over won't work properly unless the cache is loaded with the right metadata.  Author: Jason Gustafson <jason@confluent.io>  Reviewers: Guozhang Wang  Closes #462 from hachikuji/hotfix-group-loading
