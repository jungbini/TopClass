  HOTFIX: poll even when all partitions are paused. handle concurrent cleanup  * We need to poll periodically even when all partitions are paused in order to respond to a possible rebalance promptly. * There is a race condition when two (or more) threads try to clean up the same state directory. One of the thread fails with FileNotFoundException. Thus the new code simply catches it and ignore.
