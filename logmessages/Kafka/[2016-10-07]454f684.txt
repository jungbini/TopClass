  HOTFIX: move restoreConsumer.assign() to shutdownTasksAndState  restoreConsumer.assign(..) in removeStandbyTasks was logging an (ignorable) exception due to the restoreConsumer being closed. Moved the restoreConsumer.assign(..) to shutdownTasksAndState as this is done prior to the closing of consumers.
