  MINOR: Clarify doc on consumption of topics  In doc it stays:  _"Our topic is divided into a set of totally ordered partitions, each of which is consumed by one consumer at any given time."_  And consumer is described as:  _"We'll call **processes** that subscribe to topics and process the feed of published messages **consumers**."_  Which might lead to a wrong conclusion - that each partition can be read by one process at any given time.  I think this statements misses information about **consumer groups**, so i propose:  _"Our topic is divided into a set of totally ordered partitions, each of which is consumed by exactly one consumer (from each subscribed consumer groups) at any given time"_  This contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source license.
