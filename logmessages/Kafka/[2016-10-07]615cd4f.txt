  MINOR: Use `hiResClockMs` in `testRequestExpiry` to fix transient test failure  We recently switched `SystemTimer` to use `hiResClockMs` (based on `nanoTime`), but we were still using `System.currentTimeMillis` in the test. That would sometimes mean that we would measure elapsed time as lower than expected.
