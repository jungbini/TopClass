  KAFKA-3557; Update rocksdb to 4.4.1 and patch updates to snappy and slf4j  * The hope is that RocksDb 4.4.1 is more stable than 4.1.0 (occasional segfaults) and 4.2.0 (very frequent segfaults), release notes for 4.4.1: https://www.facebook.com/groups/rocksdb.dev/permalink/925995520832296/ * slf4j 1.7.21 includes thread-safety fixes: http://www.slf4j.org/news.html * snappy 1.1.2.4 includes performance improvements requested by Spark, which apply to our usage: https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/master/Milestone.md  I ran the stream tests several times and they passed every time while 4.2.0 segfaulted every time.
