  KAFKA-3341: Improve error handling on invalid requests  * Include request id when parsing of request header fails * Don't mute selector on a connection that was closed due to an error (otherwise a second exception is thrown) * Throw appropriate exception from `ApiKeys.fromId` if invalid id is passed * Fail fast in `AbstractRequest.getRequest` if we fail to handle an instance of `ApiKeys` (if this happens, it's a programmer error and the code in `getRequest` needs to be updated)  I ran into the top two issues while trying to figure out why a connection from a producer to a broker was failing (and it made things harder than necessary). While fixing them, I noticed the third and fourth issues.
