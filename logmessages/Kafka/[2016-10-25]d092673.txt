  MINOR: A bunch of clean-ups related to usage of unused variables  There should be only one cases where these clean-ups have a functional impact: replaced repeated identical logs with a single log for the stale controller epoch case.  The rest should just make the code easier to read and make it a bit less wasteful. I did this exercise because unused variables sometimes mask bugs.
