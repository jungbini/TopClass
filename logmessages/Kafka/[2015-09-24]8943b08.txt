  KAFKA-2548; kafka-merge-pr tool fails to update JIRA with fix version 0.9.0.0  Simplified the logic to choose the default fix version. We just hardcode it for `trunk` and try to compute it based on the branch name for the rest.  Removed logic that tries to handle forked release branches as it seems to be specific to how the Spark project handles their JIRA.
