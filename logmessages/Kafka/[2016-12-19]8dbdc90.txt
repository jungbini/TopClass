  KAFKA-4526; Disable throttling test until it can be fixed correctly.  At present, the test is fragile in the sense that the console consumer has to start and be initialized before the verifiable producer begins producing in the produce-consume-validate loop.  If this doesn't happen, the consumer will miss messages at the head of the log and the test will fail.  At present, the consumer is considered inited once it has a PID. This is a weak assumption. The plan is to poll appropriate metrics (like partition assignment), and use those as a proxy for consumer initialization. That work will be tracked in a separate ticket. For now, we will disable the tests so that we can get the builds healthy again.
