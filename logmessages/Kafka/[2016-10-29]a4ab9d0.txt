  KAFKA-4117: Stream partitionassignro cleanup  1. Create a new `ClientMetadata` to collapse `Set<String> consumerMemberIds`, `ClientState<TaskId> state`, and `HostInfo hostInfo`.  2. Stop reusing `stateChangelogTopicToTaskIds` and `internalSourceTopicToTaskIds` to access the (sub-)topology's internal repartition and changelog topics for clarity; also use the source topics num.partitions to set the num.partitions for repartition topics, and clarify to NOT have cycles since otherwise the while loop will fail.  3. `ensure-copartition` at the end to modify the number of partitions for repartition topics if necessary to be equal to other co-partition topics.  4. Refactor `ClientState` as well and update the logic of `TaskAssignor` for clarity as well.  5. Change default `clientId` from `applicationId-suffix` to `applicationId-processId` where `processId` is an UUID to avoid conflicts of clientIds that are from
