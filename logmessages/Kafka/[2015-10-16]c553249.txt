 initialization was not creating the file system directory if missing. * `MeteredKeyValueStore` was casting to `ProcessorContextImpl` to access the `RecordCollector`, which prevent using `MeteredKeyValueStore` implementations in tests where something other than `ProcessorContextImpl` was used. The fix was to introduce a `RecordCollector.Supplier` interface to define this `recordCollector()` method, and change `ProcessorContextImpl` and `MockProcessorContext` to both implement this interface. Now, `MeteredKeyValueStore` can cast to the new interface to access the record collector rather than to a single concrete implementation, making it possible to use any and all current stores inside unit tests.
