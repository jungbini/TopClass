  KAFKA-4183; Corrected Kafka Connect's JSON Converter to properly convert from null to logical values  The `JsonConverter` class has `LogicalTypeConverter` implementations for Date, Time, Timestamp, and Decimal, but these implementations fail when the input literal value (deserialized from the message) is null.  Test cases were added to check for these cases, and these failed before the `LogicalTypeConverter` implementations were fixed to consider whether the schema has a default value or is optional, similarly to how the `JsonToConnectTypeConverter` implementations do this. Once the fixes were made, the new tests pass.
