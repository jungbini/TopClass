  KAFKA-4372: Kafka Connect REST API does not handle DELETE of connector with slashes in their names  Kafka Connect REST API does not handle in many places connectors with slashes in their names because it expects PathParams, this PR intends to : * Reject as bad requests API calls trying to create connectors with slashes in their names * Add support for connector with slashes in their names in the DELETE part of the API to allow users to cleanup their connectors without dropping everything.  This PR adds as well the Unit Test needed for the creation part and was tested manually for the DELETE part.
