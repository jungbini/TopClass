  MINOR: Fix bugs in KafkaStreams.close()  Initially proposed by ijuma in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/1362#issuecomment-218293662  mjsax commented:  > StreamThread.close() should be extended to call metrics.close() (the class need a private member to reference the Metrics object, too)  The `Metrics` instance is created in the `KafkaStreams` constructor and shared between all threads, so closing it within the threads doesn't seem like the right approach. This PR calls `Metrics.close()` in `KafkaStreams.close()` instead.  cc guozhangwang  Author: Jeff Klukas <jeff@klukas.net>  Reviewers: Ismael Juma, Guozhang Wang  Closes #1379 from jklukas/close-streams-metrics
