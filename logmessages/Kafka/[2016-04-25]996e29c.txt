  KAFKA-3619: File handles are leaked on .lock files of ProcessorStateManager  Kafka Streams seems to hold file handles on the `.lock` files for the state dirs, resulting in an explosion of filehandles over time. Running `lsof` shows the number of open filehandles on the `.lock` file increasing rapidly over time. In a separate test project, I reproduced the issue and determined that in order for the filehandle to be relinquished the `FileChannel` instance must be properly closed. Applying this patch seems to resolve the issue in my job.
