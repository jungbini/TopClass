  KAFKA-4213; System tests for replication throttling (KIP-73)  In this patch, we test `kafka-reassign-partitions` when throttling is active.  This patch also fixes the following:  1. KafkaService.verify_reassign_partitions did not check whether partition reassignment actually completed successfully (KAFKA-4204). This patch works around those shortcomings so that we get the right signal from this method.  2. ProduceConsumeValidateTest.annotate_missing_messages would call `pop' on the list of missing messages, causing downstream methods to get incomplete data. We fix that in this patch as well.
