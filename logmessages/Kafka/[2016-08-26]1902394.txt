  MINOR: Fix ProcessorTopologyTestDriver to support multiple source topics  There's a minor bug in ProcessorTopologyTestDriver that prevents it from working with a topology that contains multiple sources.  The bug is that ```consumer.assign()``` is called while looping through all the source topics, but, consumer.assign resets the state of the MockConsumer to only consume from the topics passed in.  This patch fixes the issue by calling consumer.assign once with all the TopicPartition instances.  Unit test (testDrivingSimpleMultiSourceTopology) included.
