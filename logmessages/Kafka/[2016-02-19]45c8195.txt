  KAFKA-3025; Added timetamp to Message and use relative offset.  See KIP-31 and KIP-32 for details.  A few notes on the patch: 1. This patch implements KIP-31 and KIP-32. The patch includes features in both KAFKA-3025,  KAFKA-3026 and KAFKA-3036 2. All unit tests passed. 3. The unit tests were run with new and old message format. 4. When message format conversion occurs during consumption, the consumer will not be able to detect the message size too large situation. I did not try to fix this because the situation seems rare and only happen during migration phase.
