  KAFKA-2300: follow-up to clear the controller state upon resignment  I have reopened this issue because the controller isn't cleaning up the state upon an exception and the test case was legitimately failing for me every now and then. I'm proposing a change to fix this.  Author: fpj <fpj@apache.org> Author: flavio junqueira <fpj@apache.org>  Reviewers: Ismael Juma, Gwen Shapira, Guozhang Wang  Closes #212 from fpj/2300
