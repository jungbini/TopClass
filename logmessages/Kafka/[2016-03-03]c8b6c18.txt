  HOTFIX: Include RocksDB dependency in release tarballs  Without this change `./gradlew releaseTarGz` (and its variants) will not include the RocksDB jar, which is required for Kafka Streams, in Kafka's `libs/` folder.  The impact is that any Streams job will fail when it runs against a broker that was installed via a release tarball.  guozhangwang junrao : please review.  Author: Michael G.
