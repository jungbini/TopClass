  KAFKA-4042: Contain connector & task start/stop failures within the Worker  Invoke the statusListener.onFailure() callback on start failures so that the statusBackingStore is updated. This involved a fix to the putSafe() functionality which prevented any update that was not preceded by a (non-safe) put() from completing, so here when a connector or task is transitioning directly to FAILED.  Worker start methods can still throw if the same connector name or task ID is already registered with the worker, as this condition should not happen.
