  KAFKA-3854: Fix issues with new consumer's subsequent regex (pattern) subscriptions  This patch fixes two issues: 1. Subsequent regex subscriptions fail with the new consumer. 2. Subsequent regex subscriptions would not immediately refresh metadata to change the subscription of the new consumer and trigger a rebalance.  The final note on the JIRA stating that a later created topic that matches a consumer's subscription pattern would not be assigned to the consumer upon creation seems to be as designed. A repeat `subscribe()` to the same pattern or some wait time until the next automatic metadata refresh would handle that case.  An integration test was also added to verify these issues are fixed with this PR.
