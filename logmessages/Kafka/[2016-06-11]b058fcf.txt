  MINOR: Respect the default value of partition argument in SimpleConsumerShell  The `partition` argument is not marked as required, and has a default of `0`, according to the tool's help message. However, if `partition` is not provided the command returns with `Missing required argument "[partition]"`. This patch is to fix the required arguments of the tool by removing `partition` from them.
