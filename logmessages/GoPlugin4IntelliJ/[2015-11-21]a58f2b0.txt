 fix 'continue not in a loop' inspector  Previously the inspector would look for the presence of a GoForStatement parent of a continue statement. This did not take into account the presence of 'go' or 'defer' calls, e.g.  for { defer func() { continue // no error was raised, should be an error }() }  The discussion at https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin/pull/2024 reminded me that the continue inspection suffers from this problem.
