 Windows compatibility fixes  GoAppEngineRunningState.java:  It is trying to start dev_appserver.py Python script through CreateProcess() Windows API call, which will not work. We must set ExePath to python.exe, and set the script file name as the 1st argument.  GoSdkUtil.java:  RE_OS_MATCHER was defined incorrectly and never worked - the program thus thought that it is always on Linux. Question marks were needed at the start and end of RegEx expression.  Around line 97, goCommand was set to path + "/bin/go" and then a file exist check was done. Well, on Windows, you must check for   + "/bin/go.exe" instead...  At line 249 we were getting an exception because of using VfsUtil.findFileByURL(), and the whole URL construction and conversion back to path is screwed up for file objects on Windows - for a path like D:/somedir/someother, the URL makes D the "host" - which is wrong, and sets path to "/somedir/someother", then good luck finding it on the file system! Fixed by using VfsUtil.findFileByIoFile() instead.
