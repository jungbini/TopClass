  Fix regex for cases when parsing minimal GDB response  It is possible to receive an extremely minimal response from GDB, such as:  `{addr="0x00002033",func="main.main",args=[]}`  Previously, if an args parameter was detected, the regex required that it be present and followed by other parameters.  In the above snippet, the regex failed to match and resulted in an eventual OutOfBoundsArrayException.  This fix makes the trailing comma in the args regex optional
