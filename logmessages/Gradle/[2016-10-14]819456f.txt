  Don't use CrossProcessCacheAccess in InMemoryTaskArtifactCache  - reverts some changes from 407631c8b078c5f8bbf3fbd05142ea466197bd83 - CrossProcessCacheAccess should not be needed by InMemoryTaskArtifactCache since all reading and writing happens by the CacheAccessWorker. If CrossProcessCacheAccess is needed, it should be used by CacheAccessWorker instead of the InMemoryTaskArtifactCache which should be lockless by design. - the fix for CacheAccessWorker's workQueue's fairness should take care of retaining the order of reads and writes so that changes aren't missed.
