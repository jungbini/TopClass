  GRADLE-2444. Added integ test coverage.  1. To reproduce the problem I'm kicking off a service that is not a deamon. Service listens on a port that belonged to a daemon that was forcefully killed with 'kill -9'. Next time we run a build with the daemon we expect it to work well and to remove the invalid address from the registry file. 2. Started writing initial fixture code for daemon integration tests. The fixture is based on the output of the daemon log. This can later replace our current fixture in the daemon lifecycle spec.
