  Removed most of the uses of IvySettings in metadata file parsing  - Still use IvySettings to get top-level resolver (e.g. for resolving parent POM) - Removed namespace functionality that requires setting namespace values on IvySettings - Implemented a fixed set of ivy PatternMatchers to use with ivy excludes - Only substitute System properties into ivy.xml files (no custom ivy variables are taken from settings)
