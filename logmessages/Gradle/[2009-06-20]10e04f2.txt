  GRADLE-519 Wired up scriptclasspath { } declaration so that the dependencies it declares are available in the build script: - Each project has its own ClassLoader - Introduced Transformer interface to allow an AST transformer to be composite, and to operate in multiple phases. - Moved the project.classloader property from AbstractProject to project.scriptclasspath.classloader - Introduced ArtifactBuilder test fixture, for int tests to use to setup external dependencies  git-svn-id: http://svn.codehaus.org/gradle/gradle-core/trunk@1597 004c2c75-fc45-0410-b1a2-da8352e2331b
