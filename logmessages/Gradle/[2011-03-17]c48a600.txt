  (GRADLE-1339) Added basic fix for the issue. Now the tooling api honors eclipse's projectName customizations and projectName deduplication logic. Details:  - EclipsePlugin now exposes the eclipseProject task. This is just a first step. In future it will expose the proper model object however it requires lots of refactoring. - Added integration test for new features (tooling api handles deduplication & project name customizations) - Changed slightly ToolingApiEclipseIntegrationTest.groovy so that it doesn't interfere with newly added project name deduplication - Tooling api's ModelBuilder now applies the eclipse plugin for all projects and runs eclipseConfigurer - Added necessary dependency from tooling-api to eclipse plugin
