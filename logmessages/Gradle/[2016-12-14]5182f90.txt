  Mix in internal return types for Task.getInputs() and getOutputs()  This fixes a leak in Gradle 3.2 where a few internal types got exposed to the public API via the return values of `Task.getInputs()`. It also fixes `Task.getOutputs()`: now both methods return public types. For backwards compatibility, bridge methods returning the internal types are weaved in during runtime.  +review REVIEW-6409
