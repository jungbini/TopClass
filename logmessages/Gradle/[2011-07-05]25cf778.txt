  Removed the redundant (?) ide plugins configuration from the build. I couldn't find the reason why they are useful. After the change, the application & tests work from IDEA for launcher project and other projects that depend on it. I needed to remove this redundant config because it fixes the problem with the eclipse setup (launcher was depending on launcher and eclipse didn't like that).
