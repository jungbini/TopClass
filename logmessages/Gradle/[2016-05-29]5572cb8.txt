  Fix `BuildOperationLogger` so that it opens file on `start()`  Previously, `DefaultBuildOperationLoggerFactory#newOperationLogger` would open the backing output file. This file is then closed on BuildOperationLogger.done().  This change moves the opening of the output file to `BuildOperationLogger.start()` making start/done symmetrical, and making it easier to cleanup in a finally block.  This fix addresses some leaky file handles in native integration tests.
