  Tidy-up in the ResolutionResult public API.  1. Elevated getAllDependencies() method to the public API and made it return DependencyResults. This means that it includes unresolved dependencies. Changed the code in our reports so that they exclude the unresolved dependencies for now. When we play the 'unresolved dependencies' story we might include the unresolved dependencies in the reports, with some annotation that they are unresolved (like '!'). 2. Made the ResolvedModuleVersionResult public type return DependencyResults. This means that it now includes unresolved dependencies also. This pushed some changes in the clients (reports) to deal with unresolved dependencies. Right now we simply exclude unresolved deps from reports (see also previous point) 3. Reduced some duplication by moving out some common data setup code into a fixture code in coreImpl.
