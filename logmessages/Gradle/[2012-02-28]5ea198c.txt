  Tweaked the timeouts in the launcher daemon tests. Basically, I made them much more generous. Under heavy load some tests are still sensitve to timeouts and may fail. However, this change makes them fail less often. For majority of tests increased timeouts don't mean the tests are slower. However, when you're debugging a problem and the tests fail you might temporarily reduce the timeout to speed up dev cycles.
