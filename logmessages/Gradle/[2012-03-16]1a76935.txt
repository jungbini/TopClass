  GRADLE-1974, GRADLE-2123, GRADLE-1707. Eclipse wtp container & deployable dependencies. Simplified things around the container and tweaked how dependencies are marked in the .classpath. As we find out more about the wtp stuff I needed to rework the behavior I added yesterday. The fixes should also eliminate some annoying warnings we have when gradle project is imported to eclipse.
