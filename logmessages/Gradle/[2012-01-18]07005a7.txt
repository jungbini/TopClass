  Reworked a bit fix for GRADLE-2035 (test execution failures)...  In case we receive output event for a test that is completed  we use the parent test descriptor to describe the output. We do it all the way to the root. If no descriptor is found we return UnknownTestDescriptor. However, this should never happen because when the suite is completed we have already stopped capturing output.
