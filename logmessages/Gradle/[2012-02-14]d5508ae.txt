  Fixed bug in DependencyResolver identifiers, that caused incorrect cache values to be used for ResourceCollectionResolver instances - Replaced WharfResolverMetadata.getId() with DependencyResolverIdentifier - Use only ivypatterns and artifactpatterns + resolver type to generate unique resolver id (where possible) - Continue to use resolver name to generate unique resolver id for unknown resolver types (this is not very good behaviour)
