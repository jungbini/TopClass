  Bind task input files to properties  This change introduces a binding between task properties and input files. Input annotations automatically register property values to the corresponding property name.  The `TaskInputs` API gained new methods with an `include` prefix that allow more flexible configuration of input properties, including specifying the property name to bind the files to. The old methods have been deprecated.  Properties that were not assigned a property name will be bound to a sequence of pseudo names like `$1`, `$2` etc.  +review REVIEW-6038
