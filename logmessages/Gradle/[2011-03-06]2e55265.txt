  (GRADLE-1127 / GRADLE-1408) IDEA module names problems - fixed an edge case - dependency on projects order  I needed to make sure the order of projects passed to configurer does not matter. Therefore I'm sorting them based on nesting level. It is an edge case in case user applies idea plugin in a weird order (e.g. first on some selected subprojects, then on root, etc.). Should it have an integration test also?
