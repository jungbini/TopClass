  Add a more complete fix for finalizers-on-finalizers  When injecting a finalizer task into the node queue, we try to find the earliest location after any task dependencies. However, we were only considering direct dependencies, which resulted in us incorrectly detecting a cycle for certain complex dependency graphs.  This fixes the finalizer task injection so that it considers all dependencies recursively.  Jira: GRADLE-3575 GH issue: #710 +review REVIEW-6346
