  Upgrade to Guava 19.0  Removals in Guava:  - `InputSupplier` and `OutputSupplier`-related APIs (18.0) - `Enums.valueOfFunction()` (18.0) - `MapMaker.softValues()` (19.0) - `AsyncEventBus.dispatchQueuedEvents()` (19.0)  If a plugin depends on these APIs, it will break. Otherwise things would function as before for Gradle users.  The advantage of upgrading is that we could start to use Java 6 or Java 7 features with Guava, as well as bugfixes and performance improvements.
