  GRADLE-3362: Fix equality for DefaultResolvedArtifact  Gradle 2.5 involved a major rework of dependency resolution, including removing the use of Ivy ModuleDescriptor to represent local project artifacts in dependency resolution. This rework introduced a bug, where resolved artifacts were being compared based on their `IvyArtifactName`, which is not guaranteed to be unique for every 	`PublishArtifact`: the uniqueness breaks down when a custom `archiveName` is provided for an `AbstractArchiveTask` instance.  This change fixes equality for `DefaultResolvedArtifact`, so that it uses the unique `ComponentArtifactIdentifier` to for artifact comparison. This fixes GRADLE-3330 and GRADLE-3362.  +review
