  Fixes for wrapper cross version testing.  Some song and dance is needed due to the fact we actually have two Gradle versions in play that introduce quirks. Old wrapper scripts had bugs with certain types of arguments, and actual args need to be varied for the actual Gradle runtime.  The fix here is not very neat, but it does self contain the gore to the one test that actually has the problem. An alternative would be to make the executer bits aware that there are potentially two versions of Gradle involved in dealing with args but that seems of dubious value at this point.
