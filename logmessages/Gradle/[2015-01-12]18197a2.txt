  tweak AvailableToolChains#initializeEnvironment to run Windows + java8 native integration tests  This should fix the failing native integration tests when running forked on windows with java8.  - When running on windows, the ForkingDaemonExecuter configures the 'PATH' and the 'Path' variable. It seems this worked with Java < 8 as when running System.getenv() the 'Path' variable was listed before 'PATH'. With java 8 on windows PATH is listed before Path and this shadows the 'Path' tweaked in DefaultCommandlineTool#internalExecute. We now remove the PATH variable in AvailableToolChains#initialiseEnvironment.  - removed the hot fix to evaluate the PATH vs. Path hypothesis in DefaultCommandLineTool +review REVIEW-5261
