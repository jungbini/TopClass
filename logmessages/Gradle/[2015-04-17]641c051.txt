  refactor FileWatcherExecutor by separating some concerns - rename FileWatcherExecutor -> FileWatcherTask to better describe it's role - move watch item (directory tree / file) handling to WatchRegistry implementations - move file watching details to WatchStrategy implemention - makes it possible to adapt other file watching implementations later on - java.nio.file.Path is used in internal API so it isn't suitable for pre-JDK7 - preparing for getting around https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-7133447 on MacOSX - move Windows FILE_TREE WatchService handling to ExtendedWatchServiceWatchStrategy and ExtendedDirTreeWatchRegistry - change FileWatcherService API: throw IOException from watching - registering watches to WatchService is done in calling thread, no need for CountDownLatch  +review REVIEW-5466
