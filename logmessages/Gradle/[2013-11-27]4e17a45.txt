  Reworked configuration of native binary flavors to be consistent with platform and buildType  - Define a set of flavors in the FlavorContainer as part of model - By default, a component will be built for all defined flavours - A component may specify a subset of flavors that should be built - NOTE: resolving dependencies now requires an exact match by flavor - The plan is to fix this with real dependency resolution
