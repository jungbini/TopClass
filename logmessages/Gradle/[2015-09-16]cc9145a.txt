  GRADLE-3112 Fix JUnit test filtering interaction with @Parameterized.  - JUnit filtering as applied by the ParentRunner checks each Description in the test tree; if any Description fails to pass the test, its children are ignored. - Our MethodNameFilter did not take this into account. - @Parameterized happens to be a case that exposes this; it includes Descriptions with names like "[0]" that don't match any reasonable test method name filter. - The fix is to have the filter allow non-leaf Descriptions to pass if any child passes. Filtering will still happen properly at the lowest level. - JUnit's CategoryFilter takes the same approach. - Minor improvements to related TestSelectionMatcher code.
