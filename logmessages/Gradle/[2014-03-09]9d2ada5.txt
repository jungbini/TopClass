  GRADLE-3042 - Changed the GCC based  tool chains so that they do not require all language compilers to be available. Doesn't fix the problem yet, as g++ or clang++ are still expected at link time.  - Inlined the availability stuff from AbstractToolChain into it subclasses. - Changed Gcc and Clang tool chains to check if platform is supported before checking if tools are available, to avoid implying that installing the tool chain will fix the problem. - Changed Gcc and Clang tool chains to consider the tool chain available if at least one language tool is available. - Changed GccToolChain to use gcc instead of g++ to determine Gcc version. - Improved the exception thrown by ToolRegistry.MissingTool when attempting to use the tool.
