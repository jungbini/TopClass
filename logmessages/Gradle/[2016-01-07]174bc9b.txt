  Attempt to workaround a JDK WatchService bug in test  - The probability of the bug JDK-8145981 seems to be higher when a file change happens immediately after a watch has been registered. - It might only be related to the situation where watches are added, file changes happen and more watches are added and more file changes happen. - A short delay might prevent the concurrency bug in the JDK LinuxWatchService to occur. - JDK bug is https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8145981 - ignore the title of the bug since it also causes the WatchService to miss file system change events
