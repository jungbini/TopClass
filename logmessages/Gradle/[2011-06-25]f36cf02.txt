  Refactoring after linked resources were added to the tooling api eclipse model. Working towards tooling API compatibility suite. Details:  - Added a proper test that verifies compatibility with previous version of Gradle. This is still work in progress! We're aiming to have a rich suite (possibly most tests) that will be ran against the prior versions of Gradle. - The compatibility test exposed an issue that needed to be fixed. The cleanest way to fix it was removing redundant VersionX interfaces. - Work in progress in ToolingApiSpecification - refactorings towards the tooling api compatibility suite. Added somewhat naive support for running previous gradle version - Moved 2 tests that expose bugs fixed after M3 was released. Those tests are moved to specific package and they cannot be a part of compatibility suite because the bugs were present in previous versions of Gradle. - I needed to remove @Rule ability from ToolingApi class. BTW. I don't understand why was it a Rule in first place and not just a plain object.
