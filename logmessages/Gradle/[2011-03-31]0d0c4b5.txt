  First step in big refactoring in the GeneratorTask area. All changes are backwards-compatible at this moment. In short, the aim of the refactoring is to move out fields from GeneratorTask to a proper model, kill the GeneratorTask hierarchy, separate the xml-generation model from the data model, and more :). Details:  -moved 2 fields from the task into a new model. Since the new DSL is not ready I didn't deprecate existing properties that delegate to new model -idea plugin now instantiates the model (uses ClassGenerator to make sure instances are convention-aware) -needed to rename the IdeaModule task and fix the docs accordingly  Pending:  -move further fields into new model -a blessing from Adam - is this the way to go?
