  Some release-branch-only fixes to incremental java compilation so that the feature is useful in 1.12. Those changes will not be merged in this form to master because master is already heavily changed. This change should not have any impact on the branch because majority of changes are in new classes and their behavior is only triggered when incremental java compilation is on. There's also a minimal change to Compile task but it does not have any impact.
