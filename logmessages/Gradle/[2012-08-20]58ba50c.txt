 Merge pull request #92 from ajoberstar/gradle-2424  fixed GRADLE-2424: Sonar task fails with ClassCastException for ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger  commit 58ba50cc30def8ac9957c4ea6893b46c94399690  - Added a 'performanceTest' build type. Use this to decide whether to do the performance test setup or not. - Don't disable performanceTest IDE tasks or check tasks. - Moved the performance test fixtures to testFixtures source set and added some unit tests for some of the pieces. - When comparing heap usage, compare the averages, not the minimums.
