  Some fixes/refactorings to the daemon. Mainly fixed the expiration problem introduced recently and exposed by the windows build. Details: - Added handling for the case when daemon attempts to mark daemon as idle/busy/remove and the registry is empty. This is a common case for tests - the test finishes and the cleanup rule removes the temporary folder with the registry file. But the daemon process may still be executing and will attempt to update the registry. - When daemon is requested to stop it should not wait for build handlers to finish but simply stop regardless. I removed the handlersExecutor.stop() from the stopping logic.
