 Fix performance regression in test execution  Regression was caused by removing support for class hierarchies in SerializerRegistry as worker protocol for test execution relies on class hierarchies due to using interfaces and plain Object.class types. Having multiple SerializerRegistry instances registered that support full class hierarchies causes trouble with protocols using Object.class.  This was removed due to worker processes hanging when introducing new worker logging infrastructure.  - fix serialisation of test events to use custom serializer again instead of java serialisation - fixed by explicitly setting class matching strategy in DefaultSerializerRegistry. - remove Serializable interface from test event classes to avoid this kind of regression in the future
