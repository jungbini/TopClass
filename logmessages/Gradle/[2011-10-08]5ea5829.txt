  GRADLE-646. Work-in-progress on forcing the versions of transitive dependencies. Added a way to force versions without declaring 1st level dependencies. Added a resolver that sits on to of existing resolvers. Remaining: decide what goes to ivy.xml / pom.xml, add more coverage, fix remaining unit tests, generify the newly added resolver (it's all patched at the moment), rationalize the conflict strategy with resolution strategy.
