  Workaround Eclipse compiler bug  flattenToList(Object...) and flattenToList(Class, Object...) seem to confuse Eclipse's compiler since it selects the wrong return type for flattenToList(Class, Object...).  This causes compilation errors in Eclipse only.  This change adds an explicit cast to Class on the first parameter so the correct return type can be determined by ecj  GradleBuildComparisonResultHtmlRenderer and DefaultModelRegistry complained about generic-type capture-types that may be related to more Eclipse strangeness  This compiles under both JDK5, JDK7 and Eclipse 4.3 Kepler  This bug exists in all versions of Eclipse since at least 3.7.2: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=417288
