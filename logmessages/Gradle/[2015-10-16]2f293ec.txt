 These breakages were mainly related to violated expectations around console output when building user guide snippets. Because API jar creation introduces new tasks into the mix for all jars, this broke output assertions for all software model user guide snippets that deal with jars.  The second type of breakage was in the `ScalaLanguagePlugin`, specifically in its use of `JvmBinaryTasks#getJar`. As mentioned in d9d68d916fbc507db0ab507919b1ca802924f73a, this convenience method is now essentially obsolete and `DomainObjectSet#withType` should be favored instead. The #getJar method is now unused throughout the codebase and should be considered for removal.  The third breakage was due to violating an assumption made in `JvmComponentPlugin#createTasks` that all `JarBinarySpec` names end in the string "Jar". This is almost universally true, but not quite in the edge case presented by `CustomComponentInternalViewsIntegrationTest`. This change simply short-circuits #createTest, returning early if an oddly-named `JarBinarySpec` is encountered. This kind of one-off handling is far from elegant, but again, as mentioned in the original commit, this implementation is a stopgap on the way to the proper remodeling of these types that is soon to come.
