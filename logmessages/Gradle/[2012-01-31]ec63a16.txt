  Improved the test infrastructure WRT logging:  1. daemon integ tests now run with info level unless the log level was expliciltly configured. 2. fixed various tests so that they work if they are ran with info level (should also work with debug). This involved: - tweaking the output scraping logic to correctly find executed tasks (previous behavior was finding redundant tasks when --info/--debug used), and to correctly find skipped tasks (previous behavior only worked if ran with 'lifecycle' level). - tightening the deprecation finding assertion. Previous behaviour only matched 'deprecated' string which was eagerly matched against things like 'sonar-deprecated.jar' or 'deprecated-list.html', etc. I changed the string to ' deprecated' because it seems majority of our deprecation warnings will fall into that (e.g. 'is deprecated', 'has been deprecated', etc.). It's a simple tweak but should give enough confidence and makes many tests runnable with --info.
