  Remove deprecated methods on TestUtil (#672)  In order to use project builder correctly without having leaking files on windows it is necessary to initialize the test fixture for NativeServices and clean up the test directory after building. AbstractProjectBuilderSpec provides a nice base class for Groovy tests.  I removed the deprecated methods since using them leads to files lying around. Migrating all the usages to the "new" way ensures it is used correctly.
