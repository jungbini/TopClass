 whenever a published artifact doesn't have an extension (which is often the case for directories).  The first case is when a file without extension is published, which triggered the error in `IvyXmlModuleDescriptorWriter#printPublications`. The second one is a bug in the comparator for resolved configurations. In that case, even if a directory cannot be published, trying to access the resolved configuration could trigger a NPE.
