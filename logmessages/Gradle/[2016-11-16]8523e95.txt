  Allow double quotes to be used inside start script arguments  The new argument handling in start scripts introduced with Gradle 3.2 (#621) uses double quotes (") to escape arguments. This breaks the usage of double quotes inside of an argument. E.g.: `'-DFOO="bar < baz"'`  This is fixed by checking if either (") or (') is already used and using the corresponding other character for escaping.
