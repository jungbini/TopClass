  Inject empty interfaces for missing classes in ProjectBuilder  The code that generates these empty interfaces, to ensure compatibility of plugins compiled with Gradle 2.x in 3.x, is now used to inject these interfaces into the system class loader during ProjectBuilder initialisation. In addition, an integration test is added that demonstrates how to work around the issue in Gradle 3.0 and 3.1 (as this fix will be part of 3.2).  This allows users to write plugin tests with ProjectBuilder covering the cross-version support scenario. The behaviour of a real Gradle run, where the injection happens in the class loader hierarchy, can only be mimicked by this. This is because, in such test scenarios, the ProjectBuilder runs in a plain Java application with a flat class loader.  +review REVIEW-6246
