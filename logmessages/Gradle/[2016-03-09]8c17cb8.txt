  Throw exception if daemon log dir doesn't exist  This is to prevent from accidentially providing a non-existent or invalid directory e.g. in the use case of killing daemons. Gives direct feedback when the directory doesn't exist so developer of test case can fix accordingly.  Gradle version test cases needed to be more specific about killing version-based daemons. Daemons are only created when running in non-debug mode. Also, make sure that version-based daemons match the where clause.  +review REVIEW-5839
