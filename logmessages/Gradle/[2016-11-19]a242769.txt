  Moved responsibility for describing the build dependencies for a local artifact from the owning configuration `LocalConfigurationMetadata` to the artifact `ComponentArtifactMetadata` and use this to calculate the build dependencies for a configuration.  This change will allow the build dependencies for a configuration to include only those of the selected artifacts. This change also happens to fix the case where a local artifact is referenced directly from a project dependency. Now, only this artifact is built rather than all of the artifacts attached to the target configuration.
