  Tooling api fixes after releasing M7...  -Some of the stuff was expected to fail because it wasn't really 'complete' at the time we cut the branch. I updated the suite so that it will be ran against M8. The new features were marked @Deprecated and experimental in the docs so that even if someone uses them with M7 consumer he has been warned. Those features do not work with M7 provider anyway. -Unfortunately I needed to add back some methods to the protocol interfaces (VersionX types). They are internal so they are not affecting the clients. However it's breaking our internal contract on not changing those interfaces. -Some of the tests (the concurrency fixes) can be a part of M7 suite and I will select them accordingly. -This change should fix the build.
