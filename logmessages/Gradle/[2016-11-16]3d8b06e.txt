ks, to avoid creating a copy of an unresolvable configuration and arbitrary use it to show the dependencies of the configuration. Instead, we're not adding an additional state, which is "unresolved", allowing the user to see that this configuration contains unresolved dependencies.  It's worth mentioning that this commit also fixes a bug in the dependency report renderer, which used the last configuration renderer to render the legend. As a consequence, if a configuration had a cyclic dependency but another configuration rendered after it did not, then the legend wasn't displayed. The code to render the legend has therefore been moved into its own `LegendRenderer` class.
