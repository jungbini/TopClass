  Fix handling of `@InputFiles` and `@Classpath` being present both  `@Classpath` was introduced in Gradle 3.2. Tasks willing to stay compatible with earlier versions need to annotate their classpath properties with both `@Classpath` and `@InputFiles`. However, the detected type in 3.2 depended on the order the annotations were declared: `@Classpath @InputFiles` worked fine (i.e. was detected as `@InputFiles` prior to 3.2, but as `@Classpath` in 3.2). However, `@InputFiles @Classpath` was detected always as `@InputFiles`. This is now fixed.  +review REVIEW-6381
