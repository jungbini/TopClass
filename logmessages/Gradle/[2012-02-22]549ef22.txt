  Fixes to the Tooling Api suite. Changes should reduce the number of long-lived daemons on the CI boxes. This is especially important for fixing windows build as daemons on windows are more keen on locking files and hence leading to failures in cleaning the workspace. On linux it should reduce the number of daemons which might improve overall performance.  -Made sure that the samples are executed against a short-lived daemon (ttl 60 secs VS 3 hours). -Reduced the daemon timeout from 5 mins to 1 min for the tooling api tests. This should make certain things faster & more lightweight. The daemonIntegTest is still our official daemon stress tester and it still uses 5-minute timeout.
