  Reworked `DefaultTypeConverter` so that it no longer accepts any arbitrary object as input.  Previously, this would call `toString()` on the input notation and attempt to convert it. We removed this behaviour from the legacy DSL as it leads to confusion when incorrect values are accidentally used to set property values.  Now, only `CharSequence`, `Numbers` and `Boolean` (depending on the target type) are accepted as valid inputs, for consistency with the legacy DSL and to make this behaviour less surprising on error.  Also added some unit test coverage as there was none, and fixed the error messages to accurately describe the supported input types.
