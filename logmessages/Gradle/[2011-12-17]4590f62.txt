  Enabled daemon debug logging when using tooling api...  -Enabled verbose logging in our tooling api fixture so it is turn on for all tooling api integ tests. Very useful for debugging tooling api/deamon problems. -Added setVerboseLogging() method to the DefaultGradleConnector. This means it is not a public API yet, however if someone really needs it he can still use it. -The 'lenient' mode for protocol objects is needed more and more. Some refactoring in this area is pending.
