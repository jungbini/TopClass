  Make configure on demand work with idea/eclipse plugin  Calling `project.getTasks().getByPath(taskName)` forces the project to evaluate.

Replacing `getByPath` with `getByName` simplifies the code and fixes the problem, since getByName does not force the project to be evaluated.  GRADLE-3534 #resolve
