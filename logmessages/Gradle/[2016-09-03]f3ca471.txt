  Prevent concurrent execution of an included build  Previously, our dumb cycle detection was preventing concurrent execution of included builds. Now that this is improved, we need to block build requests for a build that is current executing.  Combined with the improved cycle detection, this fixes a bug where execution with `--parallel` could result in a cyclic dependency failure, when no such cycle exists.
