  Some improvements and fixes to `SourceDirectorySet` to allow source directory sets to be wired together and queried in various ways without resolving the source directories as a set of `File` instances:  - Added `SourceDirectorySet.getSourceDirectories()` to allow the source directories of the test to be referenced as a `FileCollection` without actually resolving them. - Fixed `SourceDirectorySet` so that the dependencies of `Buildable` source directories are visible as dependencies of the `SourceDirectorySet` and its various views, and to avoid resolving the source directories.
