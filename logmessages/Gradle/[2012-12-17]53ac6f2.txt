  fixed GRADLE-1124: When the groovy plugin is applied to a project which uses groovy only for testing, the project ends up with groovy as an unnecessary runtime dependency  - If 'groovy' configuration is not set, groovy-base plugin now derives Groovy class path for each CompileGroovy and Groovydoc task from its class path. Looks for `groovy`, `groovy-all`, and corresponding indy Jars, and puts the same one on the Groovy class path.
