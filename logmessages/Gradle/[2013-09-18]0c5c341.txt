  GRADLE-2890 - some fixes to DependencyGraphBuilder exposed by the graph serialization:  - Clean up outgoing unattached dependencies when a module version is evicted so that they are not later traversed. - Restart all selectors for a module when a conflict for the module is resolved, even if there are no incoming dependencies, as new incoming dependencies may be discovered later.
