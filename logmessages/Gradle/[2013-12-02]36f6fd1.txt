 2. Progress logger factory maintains hierarchies of process logger based on the current thread. So, it assumes that single hierarchy belongs to single thread. I don't like it very much but I couldn't come up with anything better. Perhaps we need to make the hierarchies more explicit in the API. Perhaps it's good enough for now (seems better than it was). 3. Keeping of the hierarchy is lenient at this stage. E.g. it's possible to complete the parent operation without completing the child. In the next steps we probably should decide whether this scenario is tolerable or not. If not, we probably need to change the progress logger factory API so that it's not possible to have incomplete operations.
