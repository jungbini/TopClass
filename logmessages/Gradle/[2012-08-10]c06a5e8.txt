  Consider object arrays when generating constructor signatures for class decoration.  There was a bug pre Java 7 (http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5041784) that hid this bug in our code. Namely, Object arrays were represented by GenericArrayType in the reflection type model even though they were not generic.  This JDK change shouldn't pose a problem for us in practice because both code paths generate the same signature descriptor.
