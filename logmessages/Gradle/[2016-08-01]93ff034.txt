  Fix for `EmptyStackException` processing task execution plan  This is a more complete fix for GRADLE-3127.  In certain complex task graphs containing shouldRunAfter cycles, an EmptyStackException is thrown building the task execution plan.  This change cleans up walked shouldRunAfter edges from the stack in the case where a node is visited multiple times when building the task execution plan.
