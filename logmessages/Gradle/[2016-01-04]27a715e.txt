  Changed `ModelPredicate` back to represent a fixed set of criteria. Pushed the `matching()` method down to subclasses.  The intention is to present a small and fixed set of criteria to the rule binding infrastructure, which is a major hotspot, to allow an implementation that is efficient given this small set of criteria, and open up the set of criteria the further one travels from the rule binding infrastructure.
