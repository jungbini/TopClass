  Increase file cache lock timeout to 10 minutes  Gradle locks the cache for a period of time while modifying its contents (usually upon write access). In case the access exceeds the timeout, the build fails with an error message. Often times these situations occur under high load of the build machine. An end user doesn't really know how to interpret the build failure or how to correct it. We can safely increase this timeout to avoid common failure situations (e.g. with Zinc compiler). Any issue that will still pop up with the increased timeout likely indicates a bug in Gradle and will need to be addressed.  +review REVIEW-6306
