  A few minor tweaks to cache policy - Do not override cache timeout for 'missing' modules/artifacts based on changing module timeout - This timeout is now fixed at 24 hours, and not user configurable (until the DSL is public) - When using --refresh dependencies, only refresh each module once per build. This is effectively done using cacheFor(0, seconds) as opposed to refresh(), which will refresh every resolve. - More integration tests for --refresh dependencies
