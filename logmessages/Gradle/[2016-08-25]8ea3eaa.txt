  Revert fat locking of `IncludedBuildExecuter`  This fat lock was introduced in order to avoid thread-safety issues when executing a composite build with `--parallel`. However this change introduced a deadlock condition due to the lock being too coarse- grained.  Reverting this change should fix the deadlock, however the potential for a 'dependency cycle' being reported when executing composite builds with `--parallel` remains, I think.
