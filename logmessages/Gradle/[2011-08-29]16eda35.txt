  - Added repositories.maven { }, which adds and configures a Gradle MavenArtifactRepository, rather than an Ivy IBiblioResolver. I was hoping to have username and password properties on MavenArtifactRepository (rather than have people use the global ivy registry) but this needs a fix for WHARF-34, first. - Changed repositories.flatDir so that dir parameter is evaluated as for Project.file(). - Changed repositories.mavenCentral() and mavenRepo() so that urls parameter is evaluated as for Project.uri().
