  Use same hashing for classloaders as for `@Classpath` task properties  This removes some duplicate implementation, and also fixes a problem where we ignored the full path of every file on a classloader's classpath. Future improvements made to `@Classpath` property hashing will also help make classloader hashing better.  Currently we create two instances of `DefaultClasspathSnapshotter`: one in the global scope and one for task execution scope. These can be merged into one service once we have a global file snapshotting service.  +review REVIEW-6316
