  Fixed wtp component bugs: GRADLE-2653 and GRADLE-1487 (I've done this some time ago and had it stashed).  1. I don't like fixing 2 things at the same time but reusing the IdeDependencieExtractor in the wtp component factory resolved both problems. Now the configuration settings like exclusions, resolution strategy, etc. are applied when generating configuration for wtp component. Wtp generation will get changed soon when we attack GRADLE-2123 but nevertheless it made sense to fix the current misbehavior because we had a pull request for it and users were asking about it on the forums.  2. The other fixed bug is related to file self-resolving dependencies - previously the plus/minus configurations were not respected for those kinds of dependencies.  3. While re-reading the code, refactored the IdeDependencieExtractor a bit. Moved out the logic that deals with downloading of the javadocs and sources. Hopefully at some point we can have a first class api for getting javadocs and sources.
