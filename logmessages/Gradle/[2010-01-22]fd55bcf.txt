  The UI now parses gradle's output, underlining files in the output pane so the user can click to open/browse them. Fixed a bug where the output pane would continually auto-scrolling down if a user tried to scrolled up during live output. Now display the command line arguments next to options (that have them) on the Setup tab. Added ability of an alternate UI (IDE plugin) to add a custom panel to the Setup tab as well as set the font of the text in the output pane. Added Select All and Copy to a context menu in the output pane. I also wrapped several (legal) Swing actions to the EDT. Idea 9 now complains (via exceptions) if it detects certain things done in the non-EDT. Improved 'is busy' detection by ignoring task refreshes. Adding multiple refreshes while a refresh is ongoing has no effect now (prevents duplicates). Added ability to read the projects and tasks via the open api.
