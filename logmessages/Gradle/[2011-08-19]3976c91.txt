  GRADLE-1748. The first pass. Refactorings must follow. Headline: new daemon is created if no idle daemon found. This way we can have concurrent builds with daemon. Daemon is multi-threaded so when existing build job is running, the stop command can still be received and stop the daemon and the build job. Further details: -added functional tests for daemon stuff. Uses polling assertions. Needs some tidy up. -added DaemonRegistry stuff that will get seriously changed when I introduce the PersistentStateCache -needed to revert some of the Adam's work with PersistentStateCache in the DaemonConnector. Next step is to put back those changes and keep the concurrent daemon fixes -each daemon has his own registry file, the file is renamed when the daemon is busy. This logic will change when PersistentStateCache is introduced back.
