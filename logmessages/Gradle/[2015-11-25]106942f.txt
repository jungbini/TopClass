  Added some thread safety to `ResolutionResultsStoreFactory`  Hopefully this should fix GRADLE-2289, as well as some of the recent sporadic failures around IDE project generation. The root cause was that the incorrect resolution result could be streamed from disk when resolving in parallel.  We all know that '++' isn't atomic. Fun times when it's causing the results of one configuration to be replaced with another.
