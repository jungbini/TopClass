  Some tweaks for Copy: - Changed CopySpec to extend PatternFilterable - Changed the semantics of CopySpec.from() slightly, so that params are treated as if they were args to Project.files(). This allows, for example, a closure to be used to specify the source dirs, and deferred evaluation for collections and FileCollections. - Added FileResolver.resolveFiles() - Ported CopySpecImpl to Java (after running into several annoying groovy bugs)  git-svn-id: http://svn.codehaus.org/gradle/gradle-core/trunk@1743 004c2c75-fc45-0410-b1a2-da8352e2331b
