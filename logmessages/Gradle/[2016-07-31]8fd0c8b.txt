  Attempt to fix `ConfigureLogging` rule  The `ConfigureLogging` rule is broken. It replaces the configured `OutputEventListener` for the SLF4J logging system. Then, after the tests completes it resets the SLF4J logging back to it's default state.  The `InProcessGradleExecuter` attaches a listener so that it can capture any logging output created during a test build invocation. This is done only once for the global logging system. The `ConfigureLogging` rule doesn't reattach this listener when it completes so any subsequent test will not have some missing log events when executing builds with `InProcessGradleExecuter`.  This change causes `ConfigureLogging` to reinstate the original `OutputEventListener` when resetting the logging.  Fix stupid mistake in logging experiment
