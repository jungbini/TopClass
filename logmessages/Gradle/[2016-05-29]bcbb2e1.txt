  Disable caching for Jar URIs opened by `UriTextResource`  The underlying caching of `JarURLConnection` will prevent the file handle to the backing Jar file being released even when the input stream is closed. This change disables caching for JarURLConnection when loading via `UriTextResource`.  This change will have a performance impact for any UriScriptSource created with a URL like `jar://my-jar-file.jar!/build-script.gradle`. On inspection this will only occur if such a URL is used in an `apply from: ...` construct.  This fix should address leaking file handles in `UriTextResourceTest`.
