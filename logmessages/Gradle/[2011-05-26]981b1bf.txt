  GRADLE-1529 Fixed issue with toolingApi providing non-executable tasks. Those tasks are the effect of applying the eclipse plugin by the tooling api. Those tasks are not executable when the user hasn't applied eclipse plugin explicitly in his build scripts. The fix is the simplest approach to solve that problem: the tooling api only provides that are explicitly configured/applied by plugins in gradle scripts. Added necessary coverage as well.
