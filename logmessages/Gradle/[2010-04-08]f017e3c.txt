  Added integration tests to verify most of the gradle UI functionality. Changed the Open APIs so they now call a factory function (that is located in the gradle home you specify) to create their objects (allows for more flexibility). Added ability to observe requests executed by the gradle UI. Added ability to execute refreshes with additional arguments via the Open API. Added ability to set the current gradle tab via the Open API. Improved the error checking/reporting in the IPC mechanism to detect missing gradle installations. Fixed a bug where GradleRunner wasn't reporting execution started. Fixed a bug where programmatically changing values on the setup tab wouldn't be reflected in the UI. Fixed a bug where clickable errors in groovy files didn't go to the line number due to a space between the delimiter and line number.
