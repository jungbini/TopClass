  Introduced IvyConfiguration to ivy-publish DSL - Added IvyConfigurationContainer and IvyConfiguration with implementations - IvyArtifacts are now added to a particular IvyConfiguration of an IvyPublication - Removed various IvyPublication.artifact* methods - Specifying a component to publish constructs the "default" and "runtime" configurations - Published artifacts are the union of artifacts from all configurations - Ivy descriptor is generated from declared configurations, rather than assuming a fixed set.
