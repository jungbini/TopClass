  Daemon honors java home configuration (also for tooling api)...  On the server side I simply stop replacing the java.home property. It feels awkward anyway as we have daemon per java home. Now we can honor the java home configuration that gets applied when daemon starts (by looking for the correct java executable). This change needs a peer review. Added some fixes to the integration tests / unignored them.
