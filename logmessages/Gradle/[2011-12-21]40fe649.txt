  Fixed problem with getting new tooling api models with M5 and M6  I cannot really allow asking for brand new models (like BuildEnvironment) when the provider is at m5 or m6 due to a daemon bug in those versions. So I added special case for that in the tooling api consumer code. Also, we now have coverage for that so this situation should not happen again. The problem with the daemon was fixed with one of the earlier checkins so M7 and above should be safe (given we merge the bugfix to the release branch :).
