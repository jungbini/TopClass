  Add FixedExecutorFactory for fixed-sized thread pools  This has started out as mostly a copy of DefaultExecutorFactory. DefaultExecutorFactory had some undesirable qualities: * Unbounded thread pool size * Swallowed exceptions (everything became a runtime exception) * Verbose output (first exception is logged at error level)  More work is needed to make this shareable and reusable.
