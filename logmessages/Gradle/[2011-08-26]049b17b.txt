  Added a new sourceSet testFixtures (automatically applied if project has a src/testFixtures did) for test fixtures that apply to a project's classes. Also moved the test fixtures for the core and plugins projects from internal-testing into this new source set.  Also added a build dsl method useTestFixtures() that configures a project to use the test fixtures from another project.  I don't think this will solve our cyclic project dependencies in Eclipse issue, but it's a step in the right direction.
