  Unignored the test, fixed the issue with empty resolution result not being provided for the configuration.  I didn't want to create InternalResolvedConfiguration nor InternalLenientConfiguration so I decided to hook up to the new method on the ConfigurationInternal type. This seems to be a lesser evil until we get some serious refactoring/deprecation around resolved/lenient configuration.
