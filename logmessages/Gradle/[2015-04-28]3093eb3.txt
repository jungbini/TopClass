  Specify dependencyInsight configuration as a rule targeting the task, not the task container.  This is a conservative solution to the problem reported @ https://discuss.gradle.org/t/gradle-2-4-rc-1-fails-to-retrieve-gradleproject-model/9355  The fundamental problem is that we don't self close the ancestry chain when realising a model element. This was manifesting because the placeholder model nodes are direct inserts (i.e. not added during a mutation rule on the parent, and the only case of this in 2.4) which means that realising them doesn't require realising the ancestry in order to discover them.  The real fix will be to self close ancestry when realising. However, this is unnecessary for 2.4 and a much bigger change.
