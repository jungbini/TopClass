  GRADLE-1579 Syntax highlighting for DSL reference. This is one of the ways of fixing it. Not sure where was the best spot to put the logic in. I decided to enhance the JavadocCoverter and assume that all <pre> contain java code. This seems to be true for our current codebase. If it is not true then nothing serious happens - it will may just make a non-java snippet syntax-highlighted.
