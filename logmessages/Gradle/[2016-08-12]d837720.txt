  Reworked the way that a component's artifacts are calculated, so that the artifacts are determined in a single batch rather than once per configuration. All implementations of this calculation were in reality independent of the requested configuration, either using a value from the component's metadata or producing a result that is fixed for all of the component's configurations.  This change avoids duplicating a bunch of work that is only required to be done once, for example, determining the identity of the main artifact for a maven module whose packaging is not 'jar' by performing a HEAD request.
