sspath snapshotting in several ways, to make more robust:  - we only ignore resources if the incremental compiler is used (because the incremental compiler is not compatible with annotation processors which might need resources on classpath) - the default compile classpath snapshotter includes resources in the computed hash, so it will typically fail to recognize that 2 libraries are ABI compatible if they include a resource which have changed. Workaround for this is enabling the incremental compiler. - there's a global flag to fallback to the old compile classpath snapshotting in case a bug was found. This is only meant to be used in emergency, until we fix the bug.
