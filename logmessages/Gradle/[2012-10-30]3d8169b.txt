  Improving TestNG reports. First, some refactoring.  1. Extracted the JUnit xml report serialization from the JUnitXmlReportGenerator so that I can reuse it for TestNG. I'd rather avoid reusing parts of StateTrackingTestResultProcessor at this time. 2. Tightened the integration tests a little bit. Some new methods in the fixture code are not yet used but they will be needed soon (it was easier to include it now).
