  Fix for GRADLE-3154  - The underlying issue seems to be setting properties during class initialization on a groovy class that is created via a decorating instantiator. Probably due to class decoration? - The lightweight fix was to remove the parsing of a root application.xml file from inside the constructor of DefaultDeploymentDescriptor (this seems like a bad idea anyway). We now explicitly attempt to read from a root META-INF/application.xml.
