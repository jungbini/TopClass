  Manually merged part of pull request #403  - Resolve the configuration early when determining the task dependencies for a configuration - The resolution result is currently _not_ used to actually determine the task dependencies - Track the state of configuration resolution so that we can correctly warn/fail for mutations after resolution - Needs more integration test coverage for modifications to configurations during task execution - Need to fix ProjectDependencyResolveIntegrationTest as described in comment
