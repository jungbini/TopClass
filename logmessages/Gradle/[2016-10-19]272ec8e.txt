  Cache optional task output files correctly  Previously we didn't handle `@Optional` task outputs when it came to task output caching. There were two problems:  * we threw a NPE when trying to pack or unpack such a property * we ignored whether or not a property was actually specified or not when generating the cache key  Now the NPE is fixed, and the cache key includes the sorted list of the names of every output property that has a file or directory associated with it.  +review REVIEW-6326
