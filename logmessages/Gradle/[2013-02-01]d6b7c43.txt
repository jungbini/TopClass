  REVIEW-1161 Synced the project evaluation fixture with progress logging fixture.  1. Abstracted out some common patterns from new ProjectLifecycleFixture and old ProgressLoggingFixture into new InitScriptExecuterFixture. 2. Fixed potential problem in ProgressLoggingFixture that could made the data incorrect if the executer runs multiple times in one test method. 3. ConfigurationOnDemandIntegrationTest now uses the new fixture to find out about evaluated projects and it no longer depends on running the build with specific logging level. 4. Removed ProgressLoggingFixture from some tests were it was not used at all.  TODO: remove dead code from ExecutionResult, look at the tooling api tests that need to know about evaluated projects.
