  When merging dependency that have both defined artifacts and default artifacts, use IVY include rules instead of hard-wiring default artifacts - Add a default include rule for all dependencies that don't define artifacts - Merge default include rule for multiple dependencies with same "id" - Propogate default include rule into all dependencies with same "id" in extended configurations, to work around bug in ivy resolution
