  Attempt to fix flaky `ApplyPluginIntegSpec`  This test declares and executes a gradle build, that compiles and runs a unit test, that in turn uses `ProjectBuilder` to mock a Gradle project, that applies the 'groovy' plugin. Turtles all the way down.  This fix ensures that the inner test specifies the Gradle project directory for the inner-inner Gradle project to use, so that this directory can be cleaned up correctly by the owning integration test. (Without configuration, the `ProjectBuilder` will use a directory under 'tmp' using `deleteOnExit`)  The `ProjectBuilder` may initialize `NativeServices` in it's project directory. I suspect this might be causing the DaemonExecuter to die, because unless NativeServices has already been initialized in the Daemon process, it will be initialized in the to-be-deleted directory under `tmp`.
