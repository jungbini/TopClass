  Use StartParameter.buildProjectDependencies directly instead of via DefaultProjectDependency field  * Previously, when no-build was on, we could avoid having to even evaluate a project dependencys project. Now its not possible, as we need the project to be evaluated in order to run substitution rules.  * Still, the test was showing a real problem: we were still running the tasks of the dependent project even with --no-build turned on, because we simply ignored DefaultProjectDependency.buildProjectDependencies.  The fix includes updating the test, so that we dont expect the dependency project not to be evaluated anymore.  It also became possible to remove DefaultProjectDependency.buildProjectDependencies, and instead pass StartParameter.buildProjectDependencies directly to DefaultDependencyResolver.  This way we can simply not collect any project dependency information during dependency resolution, and thus DefaultConfiguration.resolveNow() wont add any task dependencies.
