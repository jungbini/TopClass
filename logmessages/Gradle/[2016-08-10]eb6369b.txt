  Switch to use existing `DependencySubstitution` DSL for included builds  Rather than add a new DSL for declaring the outputs of included builds, we are now using the existing `dependencySubstitution` DSL for declaring what should be substituted.  This fix allows version-specific substitution, which permits the case where an included build requires an earlier version of itself at configuration-time.  At this stage, substitution rules are not resolved relative to the included build, so absolute project paths (including build::path) must be used. That will be addressed soon, so that project paths are resolved relative to the included build.
