  fix failing test - a test started failing with "No such file or directory" / ExceptionInInitializerError after starting to use java.nio2 in DirectoryFileTree. java.nio2 doesn't get initialized properly when the current working directory doesn't exist. - the reason for this was that current working directory was changed in this test and it wasn't returned to the original one. This change fixes that problem.
