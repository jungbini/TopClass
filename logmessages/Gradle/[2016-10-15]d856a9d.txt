 to use synchronous cache access for reading from or writing to a cache file.  The underlying issue is unlikely to be fairness in the async cache access queue, as the problem was observed when running in non-parallel mode, where there is only ever a single thread using the cache. Recent CI failures since these change were reverted also demonstrate that the issue is in fact not fixed.  We can switch back to asynchronous cache access in a more controlled way, once the problem is fixed.
