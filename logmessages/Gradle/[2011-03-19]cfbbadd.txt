  (GRADLE-1446) Refactored the intra-task dependencies between configurer & generator task. Made it more gradle-like by using dependency mechanism instead of implicit method call inside IdeaConfigurer. Details:  Details: -removed the hacky configuraiton-lifecycle stuff from GeneratorTask -IdeaConfigurer no longer configures the domain objects for generator tasks -new task task does it now -removed awkward 'model' state from IdeaModule/IdeaPlugin/IdeaProject. It was my earlier refactoring and didn't make much sense in a first place...  Pending: -documentation for GeneratorTask -fix eclipse plugin
