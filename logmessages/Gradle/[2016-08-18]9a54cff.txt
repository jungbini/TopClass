  Convert AsyncDispatch test from JMock to Groovy  Converted MultithreadedTestCase to a Rule in order to use this for this test. It looks like we have multiple classes for testing concurrent code. There is  - org.gradle.test.fixtures.concurrent.ConcurrentSpec (67 usages) - org.gradle.test.fixtures.ConcurrentTestUtil (~60 usages) - org.gradle.util.ConcurrentSpecification (10 subclasses), which uses ConcurrentTestUtil  It would be nice to have one class going forward. MultithreadedTestCase has currently four subclasses, of which two are JMock tests. It would be nice to get rid of this one at least, but to me it is not obvious how the feature waiting on a `tick` is covered by the other test utilities.
