  Don't render module dependencies in the component report  This is a quick fix, because the rendering was ugly and external dependencies are not particularly useful here. (I think local dependencies are probably more useful).  The long-term solution is to provide a better dependencies report, and perhaps to display dependencies in the component report only if they resolve to a local component, rather than based on how they are declared. More design work is required.  +review REVIEW-5650
