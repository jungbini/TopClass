  Do not export API packages recursively  This change incorporates review feedback from @melix that the path matching being done for exported packages is too greedy. When a user declares `exports 'com.example.pkg'` within an api specification, we should export *only* that package, and avoid exporting any of its subpackages unless they too are separately and explicitly declared.  Test cases have are also updated to corner this bug.
